<br>
 This story takes place in the deep south. Mary, the scrub woman, is scrubbing
clothes in the old-fashioned way - on the scrub board, in a tub of hot water.
She is talking with her boss, Miss Cook.<br>
<br>
 MARY: Yassum, Miz Cook. I'se prayin' dat dese here clothes gonna shine like
snow. I shore usin' all mah elbow grease on 'em.<br>
<br>
 MISS COOK: That's fine, Mary. By the way, how do you like your new pastor?<br>
<br>
 MARY: Oh, I ain't so keyed up 'bout him. He puts 'bout three grains of wheat
in 'bout five bushels of chaff. So, yest'day I decided to go to another church
- de Shinin' Lights meetin' house. Why, dat Preachah Jones got de skull of a
lawyah. He say:<br>
<br>
 
<div class="indent">Ever since de Garden of Eden, mortal man been snoopin'
aroun' - sticking his nose into things he got no business with. An' you know
what's de lates' thing he uncovered? (pause) De atom bomb!<br>
<br>
 My, my! Mortal man shore got a live coal in his hand. He don't dare hold onto
it, an' he don't dare let it go! That little old atom bomb done exploded more
commotion than anything that's happen since Adam and Eve foul things up back in
the Garden of Eden.</div>
<br>
 (Looks around) 'scuse me, Miss Cook. I done look for my child Martha Anna -
she supposed to help me with these clothes. Anyhow, dat preachah went on:<br>
<br>
 
<div class="indent">Man gone and split up something he ain't never laid his two
black eyes on. Now, there's some of my flock that say they can't find the
kingdom of heaven because they can't see it. Well, man done found the atom what
he couldn't see, didn't he? Tell me now, brethren, why mortal man all a sudden
get so smart he see what he couldn't see? Was it because he done gone to some
cemetery to get edified? No, sir! He just follow that premonition in the Bible
what say, "seek and ye shall find." And he just knowed he gonna find something
and he do. That's the way about the kingdom of heaven. Why, God say in His Word
that he gonna choose the weak things of this world to mix up the mighty, and
that's exactly what done come to pass. That little atom done have enough power
to dynamite this old world clear into eternity. My fellow pilgrims, we is like
the atom bomb. We's little, but we's Niagaras inside if we harness up to the
kingdom of heaven. What we is on the inside'll be married to what we's doing on
the outside and - man - that's a combustible partnership. That just naturally
sets off a chain reaction.<br>
<br>
<center>A Stephen sets a Paul on fire, an' a Paul sets a Silas on fire,<br>
an' a Billy Graham sets America on fire,<br>
 an' those fires rage right on down to now.</center>
<br>
 An' de seniors of _____________ done set each other on fire with their
enthusiasm and zest for life. HALLELUJAH!</div>
<br>
 Whoo-ee, Miz Cook, shivers jes' ran up an' down my spine bone. <br>
<br>
 MISS COOK: Thanks for the sermon, Mary. I've got to be going now. (Looks) I
think I see Martha Anna coming.<br>
<br>
 MARY: Oh, wait 'til I get my hands on Mahtha Anna! She's gonna get an atom
bomb 'splosion right where she sits herself down. 'Bye, Miz Cook, ma'am.<br>
<br>
 MARY: (speaks to child) Mahtha Anna! Where you bin, child? What you got to say
for yourself? You were supposed to be here an hour ago to help me. Speak up,
child!. (pauses - tone of voice changes) What you got in your hand?<br>
<br>
 MARTHA ANNA: Mamma, I got a Valentine for you - I made it all by myself.<br>
<br>
 MARY: A Valentine? You made it yourself? (Reads):<br>
