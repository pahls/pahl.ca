Slaves, obey your masters;

your very best. 
Serve them as you would Christ.  Don't work hard only when your master is watching and then shirk 
when he isn't looking; 
 work hard and with gladness 
all the time, 
as though working for Christ, doing the will of God with all your hearts.
And you slave owners must treat your slaves right.  
Don't keep threatening them; remember, 
you yourselves are slaves to Christ; 
you have the same Master they do, and he has no favorites.

We--every one of us--have strayed away like sheep! We left God's paths to follow our own. Yet God laid on him the guilt and sins 
of every one of us!


He was brought as a lamb to the slaughter.
He was wounded and bruised for our sins. 
He was beaten that we might have peace; he was lashed--and we were healed! 
John said:  "Behold the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world."

Or will you yield?  Do you-God's critic-have the answers?"

I lay my hand upon my mouth in silence.  I have said too much already."

The Peace River region produces 40% of Canadian honey.<br>
Falher is also home to the world's largest beehive!<br><br>

A honeybee beats its wings 11,400 times per minute, creating the buzzing 
sound.<br><br>
The buzzing sound of a bee is in the key of C#<br><br>
How fast does a honey bee fly? About 15 miles per hour.<br><br>
To gather 4 pounds of nectar, bees need to visit 2 million blossoms.<br><br>
In a single collecting trip, a worker will visit between 50 and 100 flowers. She will return to the hive carrying over half her weight in pollen and nectar.<br><br>
Each year, bees pollinate 95 crops worth an estimated $10 billion in the U.S. alone.<br><br>
All told, insect pollinators contribute to one-third of the world's diet.<br><br>
If a bee were to fly around the world, it would take about two tablespoons of honey to fuel its flight!<br><br>
In the U.S., the per capita consumption of honey is 1.31 pounds.<br><br>
In the course of her lifetime, a worker bee will produce 1/12th of a teaspoon of honey.<br><br>
A productive hive can make and store up to two pounds of honey a day.<br><br>
Thirty-five pounds of honey provides enough energy for a small colony to survive the winter.<br><br>
Although Utah enjoys the title "The Beehive State," the top honey-producing states include California, Florida, and South Dakota.  In 1998, the United States made over 89,000 metric tons of honey.<br><br>
An estimated 220,000 U.S. beekeepers manage 3.2 million bee hives.<br><br>
China, the world's top honey-producer, created more than 140,000 metric tons of honey in 1997.<br><br>
Honey is a non-perishable food.  It has been found in Egyptian tombs and still in good taste.<br><br>
The sugar concentration in honey is so high that no bacteria can live in it. Honey has been used to treat gun shot wounds and has been used in hospitals as a dressing for wounds, burns, and cuts!  Honey is believed to help the immune system and fight infection. It is often used as a "home remedy" to treat colds. Honey mixed with lemon can be a soothing cough syrup.<br><br>
In ancient times, honey was also used to embalm the dead.</div>

The fame of Solomon's wisdom was known all over the world. In a distant land was a queen who decided to test his wisdom. She wanted to prove that he wasn't wise. She thought of a way to demonstrate that her wisdom was superior to his. The story goes that she had skillful artists in her kingdom to make many beautiful flowers out of wax. They were so good at their craft that when they finished, it was almost impossible to tell the real flowers from the artificial. When the artists were finished with the wax-like flowers, the queen placed them in vases. The queen came to Solomon with vases of real flowers and those that were artificial. She said to Solomon: " If you are wise as people say you are, you will be able to tell me which of the vases holds the real flowers and which are the artificial wax flowers." The queen presented to Solomon the rules:<br><br>

<center>Solomon must not touch or handle the flowers.<br>
He must not smell the flowers.<br>
He must stand ten yards away from the flowers.</center><br><br>

Solomon agreed to the rules and everything was arranged. What if he failed? If he failed, people would not think very highly of his wisdom. Everything was set. All the vases were arranged. Solomon entered the room with a smile on his face and looking very confident.  Then he turned to one of his attendants and whispered, "Bring in the bees!"   The attendant ran out and came back carrying a hive of honeybees. Then, he opened the hive and let the bees out. He watched as the bees flew toward the flowers. He saw which flowers the bees landed on, and he knew which flowers were real. The bees knew where the nectar was. Our God is incredible! He made the universe in all its vastness, and He made the little bee. The bee is one of the most marvelous and fascinating of all of God's creations. When we learn some things about the ways and habits of the bees, we can also discover some truths that we should live by. Let's learn something about the bees.<br><br><br>

<center><font color=red>THE WORKER BEES</font></center>
The first thing that we notice about the worker bees is their busy-ness. A single bee visits two or three hundred flowers in one hour to gather enough nectar to make  honey.  When we look into the hive of the bees, we discover that bees are responsible for many tasks.<br><br>     

<center>There are the <font color=red>"mason bees"</font> who make the wax for the comb<br> 
and fasten it to the hive<br> 
Then there are the <font color=red>"sculptor"</font> bees who follow the masons<br> 
and chisel and mold the wax into the right shape.<br> 
The <font color=red>"environmental"</font> bees look after the air in the hive.<br> 
In hot weather the hive gets too warm<br>
so these bees position themselves near the opening and turn on their fans<br> 
by flapping their wings to make a breeze.<br> 
There are <font color=red>"attendant"</font> bees whose have the responsibility<br> 
to follow the queen around and attend to her needs.<br> 
Then there are the <font color=red>"nurse"</font> bees.<br> 
They are to look after the young bees and feed them<br> 
The <font color=red>"sentinel"</font> bees guard the door of the hive night and day<br> 
and guard against enemies and intruders.<br><br>

Jesus came to show us that those who please God are the <font color=red>worker</font> bees.<br> 
They care for others.   They would rather serve than be served.<br> 
They love to help others.  When a need arises, they can be counted on.<br> 
They want to make others happy.</center><br><br>

<center><font color=red>THEIR CLEANLINESS</font></center>
The honeybees keep a spotless house. While the masons are making the wax, and the sculptors are molding it, the <font color=red>"cleaning"</font> bees sweep the floor and turn out anything that shouldn't be there, such as sand or bits of dead leaves. 
Sometimes, in spite of the vigilance of the sentry bees, a snail or an insect will get into the hive. They sting the enemy to death, and if they can't get it out of the hive, 
they  seal it with a substance so that it will not pollute the hive.<br><br><br>  

<center><font color=red>THE UNSELFISHNESS OF THE BEE</font></center>
The bees work for the good of the hive. They are very unselfish. A small amount of honey is enough for their food. The rest goes to feed the queen, the grubs, and the drones, or it is made into honey to be stored up for the next winter.  In the summer two-thirds of the old bees leave to make room for the younger generation. They leave behind them a beautiful city of wax filled with treasures of honey and pollen. They go out to face poverty, for they have nothing until they build themselves a new city and fill it with food. The bees will willingly die to save the queen's life. They keep the best food for her, and should food become scarce, they will give up their last drop of honey for her. If there should be an invasion, the queen will be found alive under the bodies of her dead subjects who have protected her with their lives.<br><br><br> 

<center><font color=red>THE DRONES</font></center>
They are lazy, untidy, greedy, and selfish. They do not like to work, and they hinder others who want to work.  Do you know any Christians like that?  The drone eats more than a worker bee. It takes five or six worker bees to provide him enough food. He looks out for the corners in the hive and eats honey. In the hottest days of the summer, he will go out for a flight. But he doesn't go out to gather pollen or do anything that resembles work. Oh no, he goes out to lay on a flower and sun himself. Then when the day grows cooler, he goes back into the hive for a snooze. The wise little worker bees know that they have no food to spare to keep useless bees alive during the winter. So, one day a signal goes out. The sentry bees and the worker bees decide that they will not tolerate these loafers any longer! They either fall on them and stab them to death, or they turn them out to starve.<br><br><br> 

<center><font color=red>DON'T BE A DRONE!</font><br>
There are Christians who act like drones.<br> 
They are lazy, untidy, greedy, and selfish. They want to be seen.<br> 
They want the biggest piece of the cake or the biggest slice of the pie.<br> 
They want to be recognized.  They make other people uncomfortable.<br> 
They push and shove others aside to get to the head of the line.<br><br><br>

<font color=red>THANKFULNESS</font><br>
After Jesus had risen from the tomb, He met his disciples on the lake shore<br> 
and asked them if they had anything to eat.   They gave him some cooked fish and a<br> piece of honeycomb!   I believe that Jesus would have said,<br> 
<font color=red><i>"Thank you, Father, for food so sweet!"</i></font></div><br><br>
