<br>
 My husband Fred was chaplain at a seniors' retirement complex for four years.
What a great time we had with the seniors in our younger years. Some of the
events which caused seniors lingering grief were the death of a spouse and/or
son or daughter, regret for unhappy family relationships, physical/mental
infirmities, and on a lesser scale, the lack of records for their family
history. <br>
<br>
 I, personally, belong to a small family group since I had no brothers or
sisters. In my family branch, very little was ever said about family members
who did not live close geographically. I have practically nothing to pass on to
my children. This is a real regret in my life. In 1986, I was challenged to try
obtaining information for the Pahl side of the family, and I started out with a
modest booklet. Although my production was amateurish, my premise was something
was better than nothing. The co-operation of the Pahl family members has been
most gratifying, and most of the 80 or so descendants have helped to gather
historical family information. <br>
<br>
 Where does one start? Gifted genealogists start way, way back. Lacking this
expertise, I started with the grandparents of my husband. Grandpa Pahl was born
in 1873. Since the family originated in Europe, it would have been difficult to
go much farther back in the ancestry. <br>
<br>
 I will not be including the whole genealogy - just snippets to give you a few
ideas as to what you can with your family history. The Pahl booklet can be
obtained by ordering it (1) on a CD disc, (2) a computer print-out, or (3) I'd
be glad to send it to you via an e-mail attachment.<br>

<center>FAMILY TIES<br>
<br><div class=smaller>  
 A FAMILY IS THE CORNERSTONE OF ALL THAT MAN HOLDS GOOD.<br>
A FAMILY IS A SYMBOL OF UNIVERSAL BROTHERHOOD.<br>
A FAMILY HOME IS A CLASSROOM, YOU LIVE AND LEARN TOGETHER,<br>
YOU LEARN THE ART OF LOYALTY - A PORT IN STORMY WEATHER.<br>
A FAMILY IS WHERE LOVE ABIDES, WHERE TIES ARE STRONG AND TRUE,<br>
WHERE JOYS ARE SHARED THROUGHOUT THE YEARS 
AS YOU GO SMILING THROUGH.<br>
A FAMILY IS A SACRED GIFT, A GIFT OF GOD'S PURE GRACE,<br>
HOW WONDERFUL IT IS TO HAVE A FAMILY'S WARM EMBRACE.</div>

<center>GRANDMA CLIMBED THE FAMILY TREE<br>
<br><div class=smaller>
 There's been a change in Grandma, we've noticed as of late.<br>
She's always reading history, or jotting down some date.<br>
She's tracing back the family, we'll all have pedigrees,<br>
Grandma's got a hobby, she's climbing Family Trees.<br>
<br>
 Poor Grandpa does the cooking, and now - or so he states -<br>
He even has to wash the cups and dinner plates.<br>
Well, Grandma can't be bothered, she's busy as a bee,<br>
Compiling genealogy for the Family Tree.<br>
<br>
 She has not time to baby-sit, the curtains are a fright.<br>
No buttons left on Grandpa&sup1;s shirts, the flower bed's a sight.<br>
She's given up her club work, the serials on TV,<br>
The only thing she does nowadays is climb that Family Tree.<br>
<br>
 The mail is all for Grandma, it comes from near and far.<br>
A photo, a story, and history of those who are so dear.<br>
A monumental project - to that we all agree,<br>
A worthwhile avocation - to climb the Family Tree.<br>
<br>
 She wanders through the graveyard in search of dates and name,<br>
The rich, the poor, the in-between, all sleeping there the same.<br>
She pauses now and then to rest, fanned by a gentle breeze,<br>
That blows above the Fathers of all our Family Trees.<br>
<br>
 Now some folks came from Scotland, some from Galway Bay,<br>
Some were French as pastry, some German all the way.<br>
Some went on West to stake their claims, some stayed there by the sea,<br>
Grandma hopes to find them all as she climbs the Family Tree.<br>
<br>
 There were pioneers and patriots mixed with our kith and kin,<br>
Who blazed the paths of wilderness and fought through thick and thin.<br>
But none more staunch than Grandma, whose eyes light up with glee,<br>
Each time she finds a missing branch for the Family Tree.<br>
<br>
 Their skills were wide and varied from carpenter to cook,<br>
And thankfully, Grandma's research didn't yield a crook.<br>
Preacher, janitor, trucker, doctor, some tutored for a fee,<br>
Housewife, farmer - to name a few - are recorded on the Family Tree.<br>
<br>
 To some it's just a hobby, to Grandma it's much more.<br>
She learns the joys and heartaches of those who went before.<br>
They loved, they lost, they laughed, they wept - and now for you and me,<br>
They live again in spirit around the Family Tree.<br>
<br>
 At last she's nearly finished, and we are each exposed.<br>
Life will be the same again, this we all suppose.<br>
Grandma will cook and sew, serve crumpets with our tea.<br>
We'll have her back, just as before that wretched Family Tree.<br>
<br>
 Sad to relate, the Preacher called and visited for a spell.<br>
We talked about the Gospel and other things as well.<br>
The heathen folk, the poor, and then &shy; 'twas fate - it had to be &shy;<br>
Somehow the conversation turned to Grandma and the Family Tree.<br>
<br>
 We tried to change the subject, we talked of everything,<br>
But then in Grandma&sup1;s voice we heard that old familiar ring.<br>
She told him all about the past, and soon 'twas plain to see,<br>
The Preacher was reluctantly snared by Grandma and the Family Tree.</div>

 God looked around His garden and saw an empty space,<br>
Then He looked down upon this earth, and saw your loving face.<br>
He put his arms around you, and lifted you to rest,<br>
His garden must be beautiful, He always takes the best.<br>
He knew that you were suffering, He knew you were in pain,<br>
And knew that you would never get well on this earth again.<br>
He saw your path was difficult, He closed your tired eyes,<br>
He whispered "Peace be Thine" and gave you wings to fly.<br>
When we saw you sleeping, so calm and free from pain,<br>
We could not wish you back on earth, to suffer once again.<br>
You've left us precious memories, your love will be our guide,<br>
You live on through your family, you're always by our side.<br>

<center>IN MEMORY OF A PRAYING FATHER<br>
<DIV CLASS=AUTHOR>(by Viola Pahl)</DIV>
<br>
 Life began for father, many years ago,<br>
In the heart of Europe where nations warred to and fro.<br>
His early youth was filled with the toils of the earth.<br>
These were hard years, not much time for fun and mirth.<br>
In the army he served as a strong and handsome man,<br>
Which took him often into enemy land.<br>
But God protected and brought him safely through,<br>
And ever after he endeavoured God's will to do.<br>
<br>
 He married in time a lovely wife,<br>
Emilia Buchwitz became his for life.<br>
God blessed this union with children - seven now living,<br>
And he taught them about God's loving and His forgiving.<br>
The Pahls left Europe for the Canadian west,<br>
To farm the land they did their best.<br>
But weather was severe, the economy bad,<br>
Still they worked hard, dear Mom and Dad.<br>
<br>
 In the midst of troubles, low income, and shortage of food,<br>
They remained constant and firm<br>
and testified that God was good.<br>
And as the years brought changes for the better,<br>
Eventually to no man were they a debtor.<br>
Father Pahl kept his love for the Lord bright,<br>
He was, in his family, a shining light.<br>
He prayed and preached and won to the Lord<br>
Each son and daughter through God's precious word.<br>
<br>
 <img alt="a" src="bor_116.gif"><br>
<br>
 In later years they moved to Chilliwack so fair.<br>
Each Sunday found them in Church, this faithful pair.<br>
They enjoyed many good years with family and friend,<br>
Until ill health our father to the hospital did send,<br>
And here he ended his earthly days.<br>
We will miss so much his voice, his presence,<br>
and his loving ways.<br>
<br>
 In the midst of our breaking heart and tears,<br>
We thank God for our father, who, through all his years<br>
Did tell us of Christ and that heavenly home,<br>
Where he now is, no more to roam.<br>
<br>
 And so we rejoice; his soul is at rest<br>
With Christ our Lord Whom he loved best.<br>
But if father could say a word to each daughter and son,<br>
He'd challenge us to keep serving 'til the victory is won.<br>
He'd count the hard years of toil but naught,<br>
If he knew we'd learned well the lessons he taught.<br>
He'd entreat each grandchild to kneel and pray,<br>
And prepare to join him on the resurrection day.<br>
<br>
 Father's prayers which he said in life are past,<br>
But they are not forgotten - in memory they last.<br>
In memory we hear him praying for each and every one,<br>
That we would carry on 'til life's race is run.<br>
May we take up the torch father has left behind,<br>
And in Christ, every satisfaction find.<br>
May this solemn hour of placing him to rest,<br>
Find each one resolving to do his very best,<br>
To show forth Christ to the generations to come,<br>
To hear our Saviour say, "Faithful servants, well done!"<br>
Oh, may we as a family, some day join together again!<br>
Where there will be no more tears, or sorrow, or pain.<br>

<center>MOTHER'S PRAYING HANDS<br>
<DIV CLASS=AUTHOR>(by Viola Pahl)</DIV>
<br>
<img alt="a" src="bor_120.gif"><br>
<br>
 Ten years ago, father Pahl passed away,<br>
Again in sadness we gather today<br>
To lay to rest, our mother dear. We cannot help the falling tear.<br>
Her hands are now folded in peaceful rest;<br>
Hands that ministered to many a guest;<br>
Hands that worked from morn to night;<br>
Hands that once were strong with might.<br>
<br>
 Those precious hands did cook and sew,<br>
Worked the garden with spade and hoe;<br>
Washed, ironed, scrubbed - tasks lowly and meek,<br>
Fame and medals she did not seek.<br>
Who will forget Mom's chicken soup and strudels?<br>
Home-made kuchen and bread, and home-made noodles?<br>
Can you count the many sealers she'd fill<br>
With fruits, vegetables, and mouth-watering dill?<br>
<br>
 Our minds can picture Mother in her chair,<br>
Crocheting, or sewing something to wear;<br>
Now the time has come for her tired hands to rest,<br>
But we'll always remember - Mother did her best.<br>
Above all, the most precious scene that comes to mind,<br>
The most treasured memories Mother leaves behind<br>
Are the times her hands folded in prayer<br>
And cast upon the Lord her every care.<br>
<br>
 Grandchildren and great grandchildren she lived to hold,<br>
She earnestly prayed each one would enter the fold<br>
Of the Shepherd above she loved so true.<br>
Oh, never forget how she prayed for you.<br>
<br>
 Yes, her hands are beautiful for the work they've done,<br>
In caring and raising each daughter and son.<br>
For her prayers for us, and the tears she shed,<br>
In loving respect, we bow our head.<br>
Thank you, Mother, for your life you shared;<br>
Thank you, Grandmother, we know you cared;<br>
As you rest in heaven's perfect peace,<br>
Memories of your praying hands will never cease.<br>
