<div class="blue20">AN INSPIRATIONAL OUTLOOK ON LIFE and DEATH</div>
</center>
<br>
<div class="main">A Memorial Service is often called "A Celebration of Life."
It embraces the concept that earthly life is a joyous journey and affirms that
death is but a transition to a celebration of life throughout eternity. Someone
has said, "Fortunate the man who not only looks forward to life beyond death,
but who also enjoys the journey to his eternal home."<br>
<br>
 The middle chapters of anyone's life describe the busy years: employment,
family, social life, church involvements, and many other activities. The ending
of the book comes at a different time for everyone. For some, their book of
life has few pages-death came too soon. Those who live to eighty, ninety, or
even a hundred, add page after page, creating a volume of history! For those
who know the Lord as their Saviour, no matter how many tear-drenched pages
their life's book contains, they can close with the words, "And I will live
happily ever after." Dr. Elisabeth Kubler-Ross said, "My problem is not with
death. My problem is with living. Death is always welcome to me." I have chosen
two illustrations to describe my earthly pilgrimage to eternity: Life is like a
book - Life is like a butterfly.</div>

All mankind is of one author, and is one volume;
 when one man dies, one chapter is not torn out of the book,

 God employs several translators:
 some pieces are translated by age, some by sickness,

<div class="blue20">WHY BUTTERFLIES?</div>
</center>
<br>
<br>
<div class="main">Dr. Elisabeth Kubler-Ross used the butterfly as the central
image in her life and as a symbol of rebirth. During a visit to one of Hitler's
death factories in Poland, she struggled with the inhumanity of mankind. "How
can men and women do such things to each other? How did people survive in those
death camps?" As she toured these horror camps, she discovered one image
repeated again and again: butterflies.<br>
<br>
 "Why butterflies?" pondered the doctor. She found part of the answer from her
experiences in dealing with terminally-ill patients and the death process. Even
as caterpillars are released from their cocoons, so people are released from
pain-stricken, diseased bodies. To those in concentration camps, the butterfly
image portrayed release from miserable and horrendous experiences and helped
tortured people cope with the atrocities that befell them.<br>
</div>
<br>
<br>
 
<div class="main2">In Dr. Kubler-Ross's book The Wheel of Life she writes:
"When we have passed the tests we were sent to earth to learn, we are allowed
to graduate. We are allowed to shed our body, which imprisons our soul the way
a cocoon encloses the future butterfly, and when the time is right we can let
go of it. Then we will be free of pain, free of fears, and free of worries -
free as a beautiful butterfly . . . Death is but a transition from this life to
another existence where there is no more pain and anguish."</div>

 Like the butterfly, so fine and so free.<br>
 Let my heart take wings and without a care,<br>
 Let me spread enjoyment everywhere!"<br>
 "My Child," said the Lord, "it's up to you.<br>
 Are you willing to trust me, like the butterflies do?"<br>
 "Yes, Lord, I trust you," was my glib reply,<br>
 (How much could it cost -- to be a butterfly?)<br>
 "Fine," said the Lord, "let's get on with it then,<br>
 Because first you must die - and that's how we begin!"<br>
 My heart skipped a beat, and my stomach grew tight,<br>
 As I said to the Lord, "Did I hear you right?"<br>
 "My Child," said the Lord, "surely you know -<br>
 The worm has to die, so that beauty can grow.<br>
 It's not easy, that's true, but My way is best,<br>
 And I'll be beside you all through your test."<br>
 Then the Lord took His finger and touched my heart;<br>
 And began to probe each secret part.<br>
 Each place He touched was exposed to the light,<br>
 And I could see myself as only He might.<br>
 Unforgiveness, anger, selfishness, too.<br>
 All had to go, if I would be new.<br>
 "I'm sorry," I cried, "please help me to DIE.<br>
 I do so want to be your BUTTERFLY."<br>
 "I love you, Jesus," was all I could say,<br>
 "Come into my heart, And make it Yours today.<br>
 Whatever it takes, Lord, I'm ready now,<br>
 Your servant is waiting, just show me how."<br>

<center>Though life's earthly story must come to an end,<br>
 Much more awaits us in glory, dear friend.<br>
When the troubles and struggles of life are o'er,<br>
 We'll greet each other on the golden shore.<br>
<br>
 We'll pass through pearly gates and see our great King,<br>
 The portals of heaven will ring as we sing,<br>
"Crown Him - crown Him Lord of all for evermore."<br>
 Angels join the chorus as our Lord we adore.<br>
<br>
 Heaven's resplendent with gems gleaming bright,<br>
Beryl, Pearl, Topaz, Sapphire, and Chrysolite,<br>
In that city where we'll never grow old,<br>
The streets are paved with priceless, precious gold.<br>

<center>Though some of life's "pages" were stained with tears,<br>
Our Lord was with us to calm all our fears.<br>
Many pages were filled with times of gladness<br>
Far surpassing the times of gloom and sadness.<br>
<br>
 One day, dear friend, we'll continue the story<br>
Of abundant life in heaven's glory.<br>
Our Lord's hand we'll clasp, and celebrate with praise,<br>
Our exalted King through eternal days.<br>

<center>When the pearly gates are opened To a sinner "sav'd by grace,"<br>
When thro' everlasting mercy, I behold my Saviour's face,<br>
When I enter in the mansions Of the city bright and fair,<br>
I shall have a royal welcome, For I'll be no stranger there.<br>
<br>
 I'll be no stranger there, Jesus will my place prepare;<br>
He will meet me, He will greet me, I shall be no stranger there.<br>

How joyful is the thought that lingers,<br>
 When lov'd ones cross death's sea,<br>
That when our labours here are ended,<br>
 With them we'll ever be.<br>
<br>
No parting words shall e'er be spoken,<br>
 In that bright land of flow'rs,<br>
But songs of joy and peace and gladness,<br>
 Shall ever more be ours.<br>
<br>
We'll never say "good-bye" in heav'n;<br>
 We'll never say "good-bye,"<br>
For in that land of joy and song,<br>
 We'll never say "good-bye."<br>

<br>
<br>
 
<center>Last night I lay a sleeping,<br>
 There came a dream so fair,<br>
I stood in old Jerusalem Beside the temple there.<br>
I heard the children singing,<br>
 And ever as they sang,<br>
Methought the voice of angels From heav'n in answer rang;</center>
<br>
<br>
 
<center><img alt="a" src="cel_515.gif"></center>
<br>
<br>
 
<center>Jerusalem! Jerusalem! Lift up your gates and sing,<br>
Hosanna in the highest! Hosanna to your king!<br>
And then methought my dream was changed,<br>
 The streets no longer rang,<br>
Hushed were the loud hosannas,<br>
 The little children sang.<br>
The sun grew dark with mystery,<br>
 The morn was cold and chill,<br>
As the shadow of a cross arose Upon a lonely hill,</center>
<br>
<br>
 
<center><img alt="a" src="cel_516.gif"></center>
<br>
<br>
 
<center>And once again the scene was changed,<br>
 New earth there seemed to be,<br>
I saw the Holy City Beside the tideless sea;<br>
The light of God was on its streets,<br>
 The gates were open wide,<br>
And all who would might enter, And no one was denied.</center>
<br>
<br>
 
<center><img alt="a" src="cel_517.gif"></center>
<br>
<br>
<center><img alt="a" src="cel_518.gif"></center>
<br>
<br>
 
<center>No need of moon or stars by night, Or sun to shine
by day,<br>
It was the new Jerusalem That would not pass away,<br>
Jerusalem! Jerusalem! Sing for the night is o'er!<br>
Hosanna in the highest! Hosanna forever more!<br>
<div class=author>(words by F. E. Weatherly; music by Stephen Adams)</div></center>
<br>
<br>
 
<center><img alt="a" src="cel_519.gif"></center>
<br>
<br>
 
<center>There is singing up in heaven such as we have never known<br>
Where the angels sing the praises of the Lamp upon the throne,<br>
Their sweet harps are ever tuneful and their voices always clear,<br>
Oh, that we might be more like them while we serve the Master here.</center>
<br>
<br>
 
<center><img alt="a" src="cel_520.gif"></center>
<br>
<br>
 
<center>But I hear another anthem blending voices clear and strong,<br>
"Unto Him that hath redeemed us and has bought us," is the song.<br>
"We have come thro' tribulations to this land so fair and bright,<br>
In the fountain freely flowing He hath made our garments white."<br>
Then the angels stand and listen, for they cannot join that song,<br>
Like the sound of many waters, by that happy, blood-wash'd throng<br>
For they sing about great trials, battles fought and vict'ries won,<br>
And they praise their great Redeemer who hath said to them, "Well done."<br>
So, although I'm not an angel, yet I know that over there,<br>
I will join a blessed chorus that the angels cannot share;<br>
I will sing about my Saviour who upon dark Calgary,<br>
Freely pardoned my transgressions, died to set a sinner free.</center>
<br>
<br>
 
<center><img alt="a" src="cel_521.gif"></center>
<br>
<br>
 
<center>Holy, holy, is what the angels sing,<br>
and I expect to help them make the courts of heaven ring;<br>
But when I sing redemption's story, they will fold their wings,<br>
For angels never felt the joys that our salvation brings.<br>
