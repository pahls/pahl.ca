From 1981 to 1985, Fred was Chaplain at Evergreen Baptist Home in White Rock,
B.C. The home had a six-storey high-rise for those who were able to live
independently, and then there was a care section for those who required more
assistance. About 300 residents lived at the complex. <br>
<br>
 These were four wonderful years. Fred was sixty years old when he began his
ministry there, and Viola was 56. These ages were considered "young" by the
residents of Home. The Home boasts a beautiful chapel, and there is always a
full-time chaplain on hand to minister to the residents. It was during Fred's
ministry that a small musical ensemble joined with the pianist and organist to
render a fifteen-minute prelude, plus special numbers. Viola played a Hawaiian
steel guitar, and there was a violinist. The Pahls then retired on Vancouver
Island, but years later when they returned to the mainland, they started to
attend the services at Evergreen Baptist Home again. Now there are ten
musicians in the orchestra (see write-up under "NOTE" WORTHY, farther down).
<br>
<br>
 One item which caught people's attention was the fact that <i>every</i> day
there were organ recitals at Evergreen Home. Wow! they reasoned, it must be
wonderful to have organ recitals every day in the workplace. Please read about
these "organ" recitals below. <br>
 <br>

<br>
<center>B. ORGAN RECITALS</center>
<br>
<center><img alt="104" src="sen_104.gif"></center>
<br>
 Yes, indeed, not only once a day did Fred hear organ recitals - sometimes it
was from early morning until late at night. What a lovely atmosphere to work
in, you may exclaim - music all day long. Residents took turns, and each organ
recital, though different, followed a similar theme. Fred listened patiently to
these recitals, knowing that one day he, too, would be part of the "organ
recital" gang. One resident recited the ordeals of heart attacks; another, the
pain of kidney stones; and others suffered distress with liver or lungs. And on
and on the organ recitals went! (Note: These recitals are not boring to a
Chaplain. He is there to encourage and to pray with those who are going through
tough times.)<br>

 Surviving setbacks with a smile and song.<br>

<center>C. FIVE FATEFUL WORDS</center>
<br>
<center><img alt="106" src="sen_106.gif"></center>
<br>
 
<center>For some of the "fun" programs, Viola often made up<br>
a humorous reading or poem.<br>
The following, entitled "<font color="blue">Five Fateful Words</font>," will
make you chuckle.</center>
<br>
 Ladies and gentlemen, even though it is a beautiful day, I must share with you
something which, alas, shows that we are living in dreadful times. Our country
is facing a recession; many are out of work; these are hard times. Although I
realized that things were bad, I didn't realize the seriousness of the
situation until I saw a sign over a funeral home which had only <font color=
"blue">five little words</font> hung at their front door. Only <font color=
"blue">five little words</font>, you might say, but those <font color=
"blue">five little words</font> were loaded with horrifying portent. <font
color="blue">FIVE LITTLE WORDS</font>, mind you - a simple, imperative
sentence, with an elliptical subject, a compound predicate in the active voice,
one tiny little adverb, and two correlative conjunctions. It read&hellip;<br>
<br>
 Well before I tell you, let me say that I have always considered funeral homes
to be the epitome of dignity. Here, if no other place in the world, you should
be able to find sympathy, consolation, quietly hushed voices, muted
understanding. But now it gives me great inner pain to report that the funeral
parlour, once dignified, decent, decorous, deferential, demure, discreet, has
now been denuded of decency. It has become decadent, despicable, disgraceful,
and distasteful. <br>
<br>
 Ladies and gentlemen, I even hesitate to tell you what I read on the sign in
the funeral parlour. Should I burden your delicate ears and sensitive minds
with such trite? Well, it is only because you coax me with your eager
expressions of questioning looks that I will tell you. But before I tell you,
let me say, that when a funeral parlour has to erect such a sign on its
premises, the world is really falling apart, and the recession is of such
profound magnitude that we, as thinking citizens, must apply ourselves to the
desperate problems which beset our society.<br>
<br>
 The sign read... oh dear... should I really tell you? Again, your facial
expressions all but shout at me: HURRY UP - YOU FOOL - TELL US WHAT THE SIGN
SAID!<br>
<br>
 Listen carefully, for I shall say it but once. I cannot bring myself to repeat
the horrendous words. These five little words - these five <font color=
"red"><i>explosive</i></font> words are:<br>
<br>
 
<center><font color="red">EITHER PAY, OR DON'T DIE!</font></center>
<br>
 And I tell you, ladies and gentlemen, it is a shocking shame when we don't
have the finances to die any more because of the recession. It appears to me
that many of us do not have fat bank accounts, and many of us still have a lot
of debts to cover. Let's face it - we are going to have to live another hundred
years before we can save up enough money to die!<br>

<center>D. WHERE IS THE CHAPLAIN'S WIFE?</center>
<br>
 
<center>During our four-year term at Evergreen, the administrator, Rev. Rudy
Rapske<br>
(now deceased) worked with zeal and enthusiasm on behalf of the Home.<br>
<br>
He was loved and respected by everyone.<br>
In the following, we bring out his good traits in a subtle sort of
way.</center>
<br>
 We have a remarkable Administrator in this Home - Rev. Rudy Rapske. Although
it will take me awhile to prove to you what a terrific Administrator we have,
please bear with me and have patience. I will get there.<br>
<br>
 One day, one of the girls who works at the front reception desk was very ill,
so a substitute was hired for the afternoon. She did her very best: answered
the telephone politely, directed people to the various care sections, and so
on. Of course, being new, she did not know the names of the staff members.<br>
<br>
 Well, on this particular day, Rev. Pahl was up town and had an urgent message
to convey to his wife. Mrs. Pahl was in the hi-rise lounge attending a program
with nearly 150 in attendance. When Fred called Evergreen, he just said:<br>
<br>
 
<div class="indent">"This is the Chaplain calling. I'd like to speak to my
wife. It's very urgent. She's at a meeting in the hi-rise lounge." He didn't
realize there was a temporary staff replacement.<br>
<br>
 "How will I know which one is your wife?" said the new receptionist. "I don't
want to disturb the meeting.<br>
<br>
 "Easy," replied the Chaplain. "She has grey hair."</div>
<br>
 So the little receptionist tripped down to the hi-rise lounge. She took one
look and came back to the telephone.<br>
<br>
 
<div class="indent">"I'm sorry, sir; everyone there has grey or white hair. I
can't pick her out."<br>
<br>
 "Oh, true, true. She's the one with grey hair and wobbly legs."</div>
<br>
<br>
 Again, the receptionist went to the lounge and after taking a quick look, she
came back to the phone.<br>
<br>
 
<div class="indent">"Sir, all I can see down there are walkers, canes,
crutches. There must be a lot of ladies with wobbly legs."<br>
<br>
 "Hmmm - let's see. She's wearing a real pretty dress."</div>
<br>
 Again, a trip down the hall. The receptionist took a good, careful look at the
audience and reported,<br>
<br>
 
<div class="indent">"Sir, nearly everyone there is wearing a pretty
dress."</div>
<br>
 Now, Rev. Pahl is very proud of the residents at Evergreen. In fact, if I may
digress for a moment, I must say that all of you look so lovely and dress so
beautifully that you are a pleasure to look at. Anyhow, to get back to the
story.<br>
<br>
 
<div class="indent">"NEARLY everyone is wearing a pretty dress?&hellip; I'll
have you know, young lady, that EVERYONE at Evergreen wears a pretty
dress."<br>
<br>
 "No, sir, some were not wearing a pretty dress."<br>
<br>
 "Well, young lady, you'd better get your eyes checked out."<br>
<br>
 "Please, sir - Mr. Roberts - Mr. Todd - Mr. Rauser - they were all wearing
pantsuits."</div>
<br>
 There was a dead silence at the other end of the line, and then a muffled
apology.<br>
<br>
 
<div class="indent">"Try this - just ask them, 'Will the one who loves the
Chaplain please put up her hand.'"</div>
<br>
 Obediently the receptionist took advantage of a brief interlude in the program
and asked the question. Well, ladies and gentlemen, you might find this hard to
believe, but at least a hundred hands went up! Back to the telephone went the
faithful worker.<br>
<br>
 
<div class="indent">"I've just thought of a sure-fire method to get my wife's
attention," said the parson. "As you know, she teaches Business English. Just
ask who can explain what a dangling modifier is, a verb in the subjunctive
mood, a relative clause, and whether or not you use a nominative or objective
case pronoun after the infinitive 'to be.'"</div>
<br>
 Down the hallway the patient receptionist went - hoping by now it would be the
last time - but when she got to the lounge, she couldn't remember anything
about the subjunctive mood, dangling modifiers, or nominative or objective case
pronouns. So she announced:<br>
<br>
 
<div class="indent">"Will the one who knows English put up her hand."</div>
<br>
 This time, every hand in the place went up - even the German folk raised their
hands because they didn't want to miss out on anything. Well, that was the
final straw. The defeated receptionist went into the hallway and started to
cry.<br>
<br>
 Just then, Rev. Rapske, our Administrator, came by. Well, we all know what the
Rev. Jesse Jackson said: "Both tears and sweat are wet and salty, but they
render a different result. Tears will get you sympathy, but sweat will get you
progress." And so the salty tears of the young lady stirred the sympathy of our
kind-hearted Administrator.<br>
<br>
 
<div class="indent">"Can I help you?" he asked. "Here, cry on my
shoulder."</div>
<br>
 However, because the lady was six feet tall, she didn't accept the invitation
from the much shorter Administrator. But she did sob out her story about all
the trouble she had been having.<br>
<br>
 
<div class="indent">"Do you know the Chaplain's name?" asked Rev. Rapske.<br>
<br>
 "No, I don't," confessed the receptionist. "He just said he was the
Chaplain."<br>
<br>
 "Well, his name is Fred Pahl, and his wife's name is Viola Pahl. I'll just go
into the meeting and call out her name, and I think your problem will be
solved."</div>
<br>
 So the Administrator did just that, and you know what? It worked. The young
receptionist was amazed.<br>
<br>
 
<div class="indent">"Why didn't I think of that?" she said. "Oh, the
Administrator is so intelligent. He knows how to solve everything."</div>
<br>
 All day long the substitute receptionist talked about the brilliance of the
Administrator, which, as you might guess, completely bored everybody. <br>
<br>
 
<center>Why?</center>
<br>
 Because all of us have known for a long, long time that we have a wonderful
Administrator.<br>

<center>SELECTIONS FROM ARTICLE<br>
PUBLISHED IN THE "NOW" NEWSPAPER, 2003<br>
REGARDING THE ORCHESTRA AT<br>
EVERGREEN BAPTIST CHAPEL, WHITE ROCK, BC CANADA<br>
<div class=author>(written by Chris Stewart)</div></center><br>
<center><img alt="107" src="sen_107.gif" /></center><br><br>



The happy seniors who make up the musical ensemble at White Rock's Evergreen Home are part of the six million Canadians who sing and play hymns every weekend, believing it connects them with others, expresses their deepest thoughts and emotions, and helps them experience God's love.  I experienced this myself last Sunday when I entered the Evergreen chapel to the strains of <i>For the Beauty of the Earth</i>," and I was reminded, while I joined others in praise, of the awakening world around me, bathed in spring blossoms, all part of God's handiwork.<br><br>

The ensemble, consists of two accordionists, two mandolin players, three melodica players, an organist, pianist, violinist, and a steel guitarist.  "The thinking process of music provides you with a certain discipline," claims accordionist, 71-year-old Bill Wentland from Poland, the ensemble's youngest member.  (The oldest player is ninety.)  Bill continues, "You don't want to give it up.  If you do, it's a recipe for an early death.  You'll have nothing to do."  Most of the ensemble members, with strong European roots, learned to play hymns as children.  They were taught a variety of instruments, including violins, mandolins, guitars, and brass at their churches during their school years, creating in them a love of hymn-playing.<br><br>

Audrey and her husband, 89-year-old Jonas Hagglov from Winnipeg, both of European background, play a melodica and a violin respectively.  Accordionist Henry Allinger has made up five theme-oriented music books for the ensemble's use.  He escaped to Germany from Austria before emigrating to Canada in 1953.  Henry claims that hymns are a wonderful companion.  "When I am anguished or worried, I simply pick up my accordion and play and play," he says.  Polish mandolin players and school sweethearts, Irene and Eric Zimmerman, believe "playing an instrument keeps your fingers from becoming stiff."  Eric further states, "Think young.  Don't accept the notion you are getting old.  Making music keeps you young."<br><br>

And seeing the "young" attitudes of each of the musicians, their love for hymn-playing, and the sheer joy they receive from participating, I believe they have a prescription for longevity which shouldn't be minimized.<br><br>

Viola Pahl, Hawaiian steel guitarist, polio survivor, author and wife of a retired minister (who also served four years as chaplain at Evergreen), loves to play the older style hymns because they sound great on the steel guitar.<br><br>

 <center>G.  SENIORS ARE FRAGILE</center><br>

<center>It was very difficult to leave the ministry at Evergreen Baptist Home.<br>
The seniors were fantastic people to be with day by day.<br>
We truly loved them.<br>
At our farewell in 1985, we wrote the following tribute to them.<br>
Now that we are seniors, we are with an age group<br>
which is sympathetic, empathic, caring, and praying.</center><br>

The residents at Evergreen Baptist Home are special.  Some of you made a decision to sell home and furnishings, bring along your unique treasures, and set up a mini-home for the closing years of life.  Others have come to Evergreen, not by particular choice, but because the unwelcome guests of physical infirmities have chosen you, and you need the care that such a place as Evergreen offers.<br><br>

I like this place - not because of the evidence of pain and suffering, but because it is, in a certain sense, an oasis of sanity from the hustling and bustling ways of the outside world.  No-one is running around trying to meet schedules, looking for jobs, making meals, raising kids.  The slow pace is a welcome change from the turbulent traffic and troubles of a noisy world.<br><br>

Many of you have asked me, "How are you today?"  And I have replied, "Not so bad for an old hen."  I can hear your happy chuckle, "If YOU are an old hen, then what do you think WE are?"  Although I am not as old in chronological age as you, you must remember that for 37 years I have been dragging around a body that has been physically handicapped, and as far as my body goes, I have been an "old hen" for a long, long time.  Probably that is why I have felt so attuned to many of you at Evergreen.  We silently understood each other.  We know how hard it is to get to a standing position from a sitting position; we know how wobbly our legs feel at times; we know how hard and uncomfortable certain kinds of chairs are;  we know what it is like to be unable to do things for ourselves.  We are at the mercy of others who may or may not want to help us in the way we wish.  We cannot run up town, go for a hike, or jump in the car and drive to the beach to gaze at a beautiful sunset.  These possibilities happen only if others take us.  And no matter how good our families are to us, we sometimes feel that we are a burden.<br><br>

<center>Because you are precious, we handle you with care -<br> we handle you with prayer.</center><br>

When I look at you, I think of gorgeously-crafted crystal stemware and vases.  Like these artifacts, you have been arranged on a shelf in a very special place.  Not because you are useless, but because you are fragile and beautiful.  Etched on the crystal are intricate and beautiful designs - each piece is different.  And you, too, are fashioned with your own unique pattern.  Father Time and God our Father have worked over the decades to artfully produce a lovely you - gleaming, bright, transparent.  Like exquisite, fragile stemware you are gentle, delicate people.  You are so easily shattered when life-threatening illnesses attack.  Because you are precious, we handle you with care - we handle you with prayer.<br><br>

I have loved and admired you for your inner strengths which help you to bear pain, suffering, disadvantages, misunderstanding, and frustrations.  You have taught me so much, and I thank you for it.  If I can be like you in later life, I can face the years ahead with confidence instead of  fear.  <br><br>

Well, you might say, not all the people at Evergreen are well-adjusted, happy individuals.  Let us remember that maybe their burdens throughout life have been more than even we could have borne.  Let us be their friends, not their critics.<br><br>

Thank you for reaching out to me with your gracious words, smiles, and charming personalities.  You have been like older sisters to me.  I will miss the community spirit that there is at Evergreen - one will not find it to the same degree in the outside world.  And for those of the household of faith - the family of God - let us continue to pray one for the other.<br><br>

Above all, do not give up.  There are your younger families who see you.  There is the staff who see you.  There are a lot of volunteers and visitors to the Home who see you.  While I would in no way suggest that we paint a "false" picture of old age - there are a few drawbacks no matter what the experts say.  I would assert that how we cope with our problems and how we live before the other residents and visitors will have a profound influence on their thinking of old age.  We can do our part to show them that older age, even with its limitations, can be a time of inner happiness, joy, and zestful living in spite of pain, setbacks, and loneliness.  You have touched me profoundly with your courage.  Please, please keep up the good work.  Trust in the Lord with all your hearts.  Draw near to Him, and sit back in quiet peace and rest and enjoy the goodness of God until He takes you home to be with Himself.<br><br>

<center>I have created you and cared for you since you were born.<br>
I will be your God through all your lifetime, <br>
yes, even when your hair is white with age.<br>
I made you, and I will care for you.<br>
I will carry you along and be your Saviour.  <br>

<center>H.	ABSOLUTELY, POSITIVELY, DEFINITELY  - <br>
NO BIRTHDAY PRESENTS!</center><br>

One of the fringe benefits of having a daughter who teaches English as a Second Language is meeting many of Susan's students and their friends. Fulvia, a senior lady, comes from Italian ancestry and was raised in Brazil.  What a lady!  Her combination of Italian and South American warmth and friendliness captivate everyone.  Hugs are in order - as well, a kiss on the cheek.  And when Fulvia tells a story, the use of her hands makes the arration come alive!  Well, when Fulvia had a special birthday party, she sent out the following letter BEFORE the event. It is a classic, and we share it with you.<br><br><br>


<center>A WEIRD INVITATION FROM A VERY INFORMAL OLD LADY</center><br>

As all of you know, I had a very hard year fighting cancer. Because of this I didn't have an 80th birthday party last year. Actually, on that very day I went to the Cancer Clinic for my first appointment and the battle started!  Three Chemo, 20 radiation sessions, side effects and so on.  Therefore I would like to have a get-together to thank God for my life, because the lymphoma is "dead"(I hope so!), and for the support all of you gave to me with your prayers, love, and care.<br><br>

<center>Now, practically speaking, for an 81-year-old lady, this is my wish:<br><br>

<font color=red>NO GIFTS&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NO CARDS&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NO FLOWERS</font></center><br>

Let's face it!  I live in a studio.  I have dozens and dozens of kitchen stuff, clothing, purses and wallets, paraphernalia, "over flowing" drawers, shelves, and closets. Some of these items have never been used! Creams, body lotion, bath salts - enough to last me until my 100th birthday.<br><br>

As far as cards are concerned, if there are 50 guests and each one buys a card with the of the cheapest one $3.00, we are looking at  $150.00 that will be thrown away sooner or later. By the way, if you know what to do with used cards, please let me know. I have boxes full of them.<br><br>

About flowers.  When I was talking with a granddaughter about this birthday party, she said, "But Vó (Granny) I think your friends would like to give you at least, a little thing." O.K. You don't have to, but if you really want,  I "allow" you to bring one <font color=red>(O-N-E)</font> flower per family, not per capita. From your own garden would be great!<br><br>

Instead of spending money with an expensive gift (like those I have received all these years), I ask you to put the amount in a blank envelope to be dropped in the box on the table at the reception entrance.<br><br>

The money will be divided between the B.C. Cancer Foundation represented by Mrs. Sharon Kennedy, Director, Development, Vancouver Region, and Union Gospel Mission represented by Mr.Doug Peat, Corporate Relations Coordinator.  There will be a big card for you to sign your name; then when I get old (good joke, huh?) and sitting down in a rocking chair, I will read all the names and remember each one of you who helped these two wonderful organizations.<br><br>

<center>Of course, we'll have a cake -  without candles -<br> 
in order not to give trouble to the Fire Department!</center><br>
