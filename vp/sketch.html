Roumania). Came to Canada in 1927, and his parents farmed in the Hanna and
Lavoy areas in Alberta. In 1937, the family relocated to Chilliwack, British
Columbia. Eleven children were born to my parents; four died in infancy. Seven
lived to adult-hood: three boys and four girls. My parents had a strong faith
in the Lord, and our whole family attended Sunday School and church.</div>

isn't a typo error - Fred and I were born on the same date and month!) My
mother relocated to British Columbia when I was three months old.
Unfortunately, alcoholism by my mother and common-law spouse made for a lot of
unhappiness in my childhood years. I was an only child and an avid book reader.
Until I was age twelve, we lived in apartments in Vancouver's East End. I
attended nine different schools because of the many moves my parents
made.</div>

<div class="mainjustify">Finances were limited in the Pahl household, and they
were unable to afford to send me to boarding school for high-school education.
So I quit school and went to work on a farm and then to logging camps. I
studied hard to get a Steam Engineer's certification, and I commenced a new
avenue of work as a steam engineer at a dry-cleaning plant. Due to a unique
kidney structure (described in our biography GOLD IN LIFE'S HOURGLASS), I was
exempted from military duty.</div>

counter clerk at a dry-cleaning plant. At age seventeen, I passed government
exams and was accepted as a stenographer at Naval Head-quarters, Jericho Beach.
Following the war, I worked as a secretary to the Vice-President of a prominent
Pulp and Paper company.</div>

When I was fourteen, a church group was canvassing the district for potential
Sunday School scholars. My girlfriend and I responded to the invitation. What a
joy and comfort it was to know God's forgiveness and peace in the midst of a
home with turmoil. I accepted the Lord as my Saviour and my goal was to be a
missionary. On the other hand, Fred was raised in a home where he learned about
the Lord. However, when we met, he had not made a personal decision to accept
the Lord. I witnessed to him, and finally he came to our youth group. Not too
many months went by, and he, too, made a decision to follow the Lord. We did
not become romantically interested in each other until I was age twenty, and he
was twenty-four. We discovered we both had the same goals in life, so we
married and after four months of wedded bliss, we enrolled at Prairie Bible
College for Bible training. Following two years of schooling, we were accepted
as candidates to go to China upon the completion of our studies.</div>

<div class="mainjustify">In 1948, many children and young adults were stricken
with paralytic polio. In August of that year, Fred was working on a
construction job in Three Hills to earn money for our third year of schooling.
I was seven months pregnant and doing very well, UNTIL&hellip; illness struck;
the ability to walk left me&hellip; and the diagnosis was POLIO! I also lost a
measure of breathing ability, so I was placed in an iron lung for several weeks
- a horrific experience. Our son was born in October, but because we didn't
have a family in Edmonton, he was taken to Chilliwack to be cared for by a
loving Aunt and Uncle. We didn't see him for over six months. I spent a total
of nine months in the hospital. Although I had been told I would never walk, I
managed to take a few steps with crutches just before I left the hospital. For
mobility, I use wheelchair or crutches. As I age, however, I use a wheelchair
more often.</div>

 Obviously, we could not go to China as missionaries. Instead, Fred accepted a
call to a North American Baptist church in Hilda, Alberta, and that is where I
went upon discharge from the hospital. Subsequently, we served at Olds,
Alberta; various churches in the Edmonton, Alberta, area; and Springside,
Saskatchewan. During these years, Fred worked for his degree in Education.
Because ministry wages were low, I also worked from time to time: Secretary to
various health officials in the Provincial Government and in the correspondence
department of the Premier of the Province of Alberta (Peter Lougheed). Fred
also taught in the Edmonton school system for a number of years, alongside his
ministry work.<br>
<br>
 In 1977, we relocated to Nanaimo, Vancouver Island, where Fred built two
houses with fantastic ocean/mountain views. Although he retired from full-time
ministry work, there were many opportunities for interim pastoral work. He also
worked for a year as principal at a Christian school.<br>
<br>
 In 1981, he was asked to be Chaplain at Evergreen Baptist Home in White Rock,
BC. We rented a small suite in the complex and commuted on days off to our
Nanaimo home. Our daughter Susan looked after the Nanaimo house. Fred resigned
from the chaplaincy in 1985, and we stayed in Nanaimo until 1989. By then, our
son and his family returned to Canada and purchased a home in Richmond, BC. We
felt that it would be wise to also live on the mainland, so we bought a house,
and later, a condo in White Rock. We do a lot of programming for senior groups,
and I play my electric Hawaiian steel guitar with a small instrumental ensemble
at the Evergreen Baptist Home. We have a magnificent south-west corner condo
from which we see glorious sunsets at any time of the year. We enjoy a measure
of good health in spite of physical challenges, and thank God for the many
blessings He has bestowed upon us in the past years and in the present.<br>

SON - GERHART PAHL: We have a good chuckle when I say to him, "Gerhart, you are
the only family member who stayed with me day and night when I was in the iron
lung!" Well, in spite of my paralysis, he came into the world a strong, healthy
baby. He acquired his degree in Science and went to Cameroon, Africa, to serve
as a short-term missionary. Following his assignment there, he went on to
Micronesia under the Liebenzell Mission. His first assignment was as a Youth
Director at a youth center in Yap, Micronesia. From there, he went to Palau to
teach at a boys' school. Here, he met Penny - a Marshallese lady, also a
teacher - and in July 1975, they were married. Fred and I, as well as Susan,
went to their wedding. After a time, Gerhart and Penny relocated to Hawaii.
Here he obtained his Master's degree in Business Administration. In 1985, they
came to Canada. Gerhart is in the financial world, first as a pension plan investment consultant and then as an investment manager.
They have four sons: as at the end of 2005, Christopher was 28; Wesley is 27; Lionel is 25;
Neil is 21. They live in Richmond, BC.<br>
<br>
 DAUGHTER - SUSAN: Susan is two years younger than Gerhart. We adopted her when
she was three months old. She obtained her B.Ed degree in education and taught
school. She then went out to Japan as a short-term missionary. Her main duty
was to teach English as a Second Language, and that was the start of her talent
in this area. Following four years in Japan, Susan returned to Canada for a
short time and worked for Malaspina College in Nanaimo. The college had an
exchange program of teachers with a language institute in China, so Susan went
to China for nearly two years. Home again - but the wanderlust bug had bitten
her - so she went off to Australia to teach in a University for eleven years.
When her job came to a close there, Susan went to Thailand for four years. She
has her Master's degree in Education. Now she has returned to Canada and is
living with us in White Rock. Her care and concern for her "elderly" parents is
appreciated so much. In White Rock, private tutoring jobs in ESL are plentiful.
As well, the White Rock Baptist Church sponsors an ESL program, which Susan
co-ordinates.<br>
