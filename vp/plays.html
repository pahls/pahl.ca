<br>
 Longer length plays are not as popular now as they used to be. From the 1950's
to the 1980's in our years of active ministry, we always involved our youth
group in the presentation of plays at their home church as well as travelling
to other churches. In the 1980's, I was a volunteer teacher of drama at a
Christian school. There was a lot of enthusiasm in producing a play. In the
1990's, several churches have presented plays from the listing below. One play
entitled ONESIMUS is a fiction/fact play and very impressive for those wishing
to do a Biblical-oriented drama. You may not wish to use the plays as written
so feel free to adapt them to suit your group.<br>
<br>
 My plays may be copied, but not published, as they are copyrighted. I do not
charge for the plays except for any photocopying, paper, and postage. Of
course, if the play goes out to you via the internet, there is no charge at
all. I am happy to make the plays available at little or no cost as part of my
ministry. I also have some short skits on various topics.<br>
<br>
 I, personally, would like to see more drama in the church program. Because
singing groups seem to have more prominence these days, many people who cannot
sing are left on the sidelines. However, drama is a wonderful outlet for
expression as well as being a blessing to the audience. <br>

<div class="title">A. PLAYS APPROXIMATELY ONE HOUR IN LENGTH</div>
</center>

<center><font color="red">A FORTUNE LOST: A FUTURE GAINED</font></center>
For young people and adults. A stirring story of a hard-hearted father who has
disowned his wife, and later on, his young son--both committed to Christ. The
son goes to India as a missionary and a great tragedy occurs because the father
back home refuses to give money to assist the needs of his missionary son and
daughter-in-law. The father's heart is eventually softened, but too late to
help his son. Based on a true story. <br>
<br>
<center><font color="red">A NIGHT TO REMEMBER</font></center>
For young people and adults. This play takes place on the mission field. Two
sacrificing young missionary couples suffer tremendously at the hands of native
terrorists, even to the stealing of a baby girl who was to be used in a
sacrifice to idols. God rewards their faith in a remarkable way and answers the
prayers of prayer warriors in the homeland. <br>
<br>
<center><font color="red">OFFICE SCANDAL</font></center>
For young people and adults. A Christian office girl, Pat, maintains a clear
and bright testimony in front of the staff. An unwanted suitor is dejected
because Pat will not date him. Pat leaves for a weekend at a Bible camp and the
unwanted suitor tries to play a mean trick on her by taking the office money
and making it seem as if Pat stole it. The trick backfires, and Pat, who gets
killed in a highway accident, has her reputation vindicated through an involved
chain of circumstances. <br>
<br>
<center><font color="red">ONESIMUS</font></center>
For young people and adults. A five-act play based on the Onesimus of the book
of Philemon. Scenes take place in the home of Philemon, with slave outcasts in
Rome, with Paul in prison. Philemon's daughter, Eunice, is in love with
Onesimus, but can do nothing else but pray for him when he runs away. There is
a surprise ending when Onesimus returns to Philemon's home. <br>
<br>
<center><font color="red">SHE DIED TO LIVE; HE LIVED TO DIE</font></center>
For young people and adults. A native of China, You-chee Lee, has won a
scholarship and been sent to North America to further his medical studies. Upon
completion of his course, he has returned to his home village in Huang Chin.
His brother, Wang Lee, has become the local communist leader for the village.
The communist leader is trying to destroy the Christians in the village and is
so devoted to his party he is willing to send even his own daughter to death.
The doctor tries to intervene and save some of the Christians who have become
condemned. The purpose of the play is to show how zealous the communists are
for their cause, and how Christians should endeavour to show the same fervour
for the cause of Christ. <br>
<br>
<center><font color="red">THE CHALLENGE AT THE CROSS-ROADS OF SELF AND
SERVICE</font></center>
For young people and adults. Mrs. Bill Watts, returned missionary from India,
relives her life as Rita Kochuk in order that her 'teen age son might know her
background and how she came to be a missionary. She tells her son, Keith, of
her drunken father, her Christian mother, her call to the mission field, and
the joy Christ has given her in spite of the many hardships and sacrifices she
has made. Keith is challenged to make a decision as to whether or not he will
give his all for Christ. <br>
<br>
<center><font color="red">THE HAVEN OF REST</font></center>
For young people and adults. A five-act play depicting the joy and peace there
is in a family when all have anchored their souls in the Haven of Rest. The
audience will laugh one minute at the timely wit and humour supplied by little
Johnny, and weep at the scenes played by Joseph, the black sheep of the family.
A physically disabled girl is the heroine of the play. <br>
<br>
<center><font color="red">THE LAMP BURNED LOW</font></center>
For young people and adults. A father of the home, a church member, has drifted
into a social drinking habit in order to prosper his business. His son finds
out through an unsaved school chum about his father's habit. The father, at
first, thinks that drinking need not be a stumbling block. The lamp of faith
burns low in the hearts of father and son, but through the grace of the Lord,
both are renewed in their vision. Six scenes. <br>
<br>
<center><font color="red">THE SAINTLY SPIES OF SUNSET MANOR</font></center>
Two young reporters disguise themselves as seniors and infiltrate a nursing
home to get first-hand reports of what goes on. Funny, yet serious. Suitable

<br>
<center><font color="red">THE PRISONER WITH THE PREACHER'S EYES</font></center>
For young people and adults. Before Rev. Kelly dies, he wills his eyes to a man
about to be released from prison. However, the convict has to sign a paper
stating he will live with the deceased minister's family for two weeks if the
eye operation is a success. Through this, it is the prayer of the minister's
family that the ex-convict would see the better things of life through the eyes
which had been bequeathed to him. Instead of staying two weeks, the ex-convict
stays only two days as he finds it intolerable to be with a "religious" family.
However, when he seeks revenge on an ex-convict buddy, exciting events happen
which change his mind. <br>
<br>
<center><font color="red">TWO SHALL SEE THE LIGHT</font></center>
For young people and adults. A poor family sacrifices time and money in order
to send their son to Dental College. While in the city, the son meets some
racketeers who exploit him for his money and he loses it all in a
"get-rich-quick" scheme. The mother of the family suffers an eye accident and
is unable to get the necessary operation because of lack of finances. As time
goes on, however, circumstances come to pass which cause the son to regain his
"spiritual" vision and his mother her "physical" vision. <br>
<br>
<center><font color="red">UNCLE BILL'S DIARY</font></center>
A wealthy Christian man dies, and his unsaved relatives are disappointed to
find out that only their son benefits from "Uncle Bill's" money, providing he
attends Bible School. The son attends Bible School and becomes a committed
Christian, and unusual events lead to the softening of the parents' hearts so

ways. <br>
