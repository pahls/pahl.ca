<br>
This is not Viola in the picture.
The hair-do is far too nice to look like Viola.<br>
<br>
 In addition to 9 months in the hospital for polio rehabilitation,
Viola has had four major surgeries over the years:
appendix, removal of half a kidney and a rib,
cancer (uterus), part of colon and gallbladder removed.<br>
<br>
 Her sense of humor never left in spite of extremely serious days
when she was a step from eternity.
 For example, as Viola was coming back to reality following
her kidney surgery, the nurse was trying to arouse her by asking,
"Mrs. Pahl - who is your doctor?"
Well, Mrs. Pahl wasn't about to co-operate.
"Why should I try to talk when she can look at my wristband
and see the name of the doctor written there."
 So - Viola pointed to the wristband, not once, not twice,
but five times. Finally, the nurse gave up and tried another tactic.
 "Mrs. Pahl, who is the Prime Minister of Canada."
 Viola pondered the question, not because she didn't know the
Prime Minister's name, but because she didn't want to answer.
"Should I reply with the name of the President of the USA?" she mused.
But better sense prevailed. She reasoned that if she gave the
incorrect answer, she might be considered delirious,
and who knows what the nurse might do.
Reluctantly, Viola proffered the correct answer,
but she actually felt downhearted when she couldn't pull off<br>
another stunt.
<br>
<br>
 And then there was the time when the ritual thermometer was stuck in her
mouth, like it or not. The nurse briefly left the room, and Viola grasped the
opportunity. Next to the bed was the heat register, so she plucked the
thermometer out of her mouth and held it on the heat register. Ah - it went up
to a nice hot fever status.<br>
<br>

<img alt="101b" src="hospital_101b.gif"></td><td valign="middle"><img alt="101" src="hospital_101.gif" width="200" height="7"></td></tr></table></center>
<br>

 When the nurse returned, she looked at the thermometer. Like a true
professional, she never blinked nor did she show any emotion. The nurse left to
record the unexpected temperature.
 "Aha," squealed Viola with delight, "I sure fooled her."
 But it was the nurse who had the last laugh. Every four hours for the next
twelve hours - from 8:00 in the evening until 8:00 in the morning - Viola had
to endure a thermometer in her mouth. She was too proud to tell the nurses that
the sudden elevation in temperature was due to her prank. This was one prank
that was never repeated.<br>
<br>
 
Well now, out of all her hospital experiences,
the following satirical thoughts birthed in Viola's mind,
and she penned the following humorous article.</center>
<br>

<div class="title2">A. OBEDIENCE TRAINING SCHOOL FOR ANIMALS AND PATIENTS</div>
</center>
<br>
 This hilarious story was reported in a Honolulu newspaper, when Fred and Viola
were there in the early 1980's.<br>
<br>
<div class="indent">Two very timid island girls embarked on their first trip to
the U.S. mainland They were overwhelmed with the hectic life style on the
continent compared with their isolated life on the islands. One day as they
were in the hotel elevator, Reggie Jackson, two huge bodyguards, and two
Doberman Pinscher dogs joined them. Frightened at the awesome sight of
physically huge men and possibly vicious dogs, the girls retreated to an
elevator corner. When Reggie Jackson barked a command to his dogs, "SIT," the
terrified girls reacted immediately, and they, too, immediately sat on the
elevator floor in unquestioning obedience.</div>
<br>
 The anecdote caused Viola to think of hospital "obedience" training to which
patients are subjected. They are required to obey quickly - no questions asked!
Said an exasperated parent, "I'm trying something new this summer. I'm sending
the dog to camp, and the kids to obedience school!" Well, try a hospital ward
for a crash course in obedience training. Viola wrote the following article for
publication.<br>

<div class="body">What does being in the hospital have in common with Dog
Obedience Training classes? Nurses, therapists, or other medical personnel,
speak in imperative intonations such as one encounters in prestigious

four-legged creatures?</div>

Roll Over<br>
 Sit Up<br>
 Eat your dinner<br>
Walk<br>
Jump! You can do it!<br>
Take your medicine<br>
</center>
<br>
<br>
 And on, and on, and on. Whatever happened to the use of polite phrasing such
as, "Would you like to sit up in bed or in your chair?" "When <i>you</i> are
ready, we'll go for a short walk." <br>
<br>
 At a Doggy Obedience School, authority figures reward pooches with soothing
phrases, timely tender touches, and favourite tidbits, which serve to mask
distasteful commands. For these small favours, a dog will wag its tail in loyal
gratitude. Likewise, humans can be decoyed into obedience by the "perks" their
assertive professionals dangle before them. <br>
<br>
<center>When I have dutifully swallowed my pills, the nurse says, "That's a
good girl."<br>
<i>(I'm always good, in case you haven't noticed!<br>
 And I'm not a girl - can't you see I'm seventy-eight years old?)</i><br>
<br>
 "You are a sweetheart." <i>(Flattery will get you nowhere.)</i><br>
<br>
 "I'll get a glass of your favourite juice if you walk as far as the door."<br>
<i>(This sounds like bribery.)</i><br>
<br>
</center>
Alas, like our creature friends, we are reluctantly trapped and coerced into
obeying all commands without question. Sometimes, in desperate disobedience, we
growl at the medical staff. Doubtless, they wish they could muzzle patients who
have abrasive tongues. Unlike canines, who often give their trainers a harmful
nip, patients rarely bite medical personnel - with one exception. A dentist,
whose fingers are creating havoc with a root canal procedure, should re-examine
the fine print on his insurance policy regarding bite injuries caused by
pain-sensitive patients. <br>

Everyone loves a back rub, especially those of us who are paraplegic. Unable to
shift our bodies to a more comfortable position, our backs suffer circulation
woes. At the end of the day, when nursie tires of being in command, she resorts
to politeness and asks in dulcet tones, "Would you like a back rub?" We are
startled by having the offer of a choice rather than having to obey a command.
Why isn't our militant nursie following protocol and ordering us to "Roll over;
you're going to get a back rub - like it or not!" <br>
<br>
 Well, nursie is exhausted, and she secretly hopes that patients will sense her
weariness and say, "No, don't bother." Some do. But not this lady. I respond
affirmatively. However, I resist the temptation to add, "Please, nursie, I've
been so good and obedient today. I'd not only like a back rub now, but perhaps
several more during the night." She may construe my request as downright
cheekiness, and I may not get a back rub the following evening. Because of her
authority status, she possesses the power to pass me by whenever it suits her.
So I meekly accept the offer at hand. Nursie's magic massage works; my blood
resumes circulating, and my skin tingles. <br>

When I am discharged from the hospital and arrive home, I resolve to rub
pussy's back more often. No wonder a feline expresses gratefulness with a
soothing, gentle purr after a vigorous rub-down. <i>Sparky!</i> The thought of
my feline companion triggered an emotional reaction. <i>Darling little
Sparky!</i> I chuckled as I recalled how his ears sprang to attention when I
imitated a dog perfectly - I say this with great pride. BOW WOW! WOOF! WOOF!
(Dr. Doolittle would surely have applauded my expertise.) Sparky showed his
agitation by checking out the room to see where the dog was hiding. I also
tried "purring," but Sparky merely opened his eyes a little, studied my face
momentarily, and went back to sleep. So my cat-ese wasn't that great? <br>
<br>
 Well, we can't win them all; I was proficient in at least one animal language.
However, thinking of Sparky inspired a daring and brazen plan. Perhaps nursie
could be fooled with cat-ese language. <i>In spite of my illness, it was time
to "get even" with the well-intentioned, but nonetheless, demanding authority
figure.</i><br>
<br>
 Finally, after a tough day at obedience school, I laid back in bed, relaxed,
and put my plan into action. Summoning my last reservoir of strength, I quietly
started to MEOW. Although Sparky would have meowed his disapproval at my
cat-ese accent, it was good enough to fool nursie know-it-all. <br>

 The medical drillmaster paused at the door, listened intently, and her face
formed a quizzical expression as she detected a faint but familiar sound. Was
her weary mind playing a trick? Did she really hear a cat meowing&hellip;? It
couldn't be; no cats would ever be allowed in <i>her</i> ward! Professional
decorum prevented her from asking the patients if they had heard the same
sound. Because it appeared to come from my direction, she riveted her
steely-grey eyes on me with a militant air which expressed
"I-will-not-allow-nonsense-in-my-domain." However, I laid very still, closed my
eyes to a mere slit, and breathed heavily as if I were blissfully sleeping.
<br>
<br>
 As I saw a subdued nursie retreating from the room, I shouted an inward,
silent HURRAH. I knew beyond a doubt she would go home and tell her family that
due to overwork, she was hearing things which didn't exist. I felt ecstatic! My
cat-ese strategy had worked. <br>
<br>

 You'll get an extra helping of your favourite cat food when I get

<div class="title2">B. DON'T VISIT ME IN THE HOSPITAL</div>
when church members are dying embers</center>
<br>
 
<center><img alt="111" src="hospital_111.gif"></center>
<br>
 The pastor meant well when he announced to the group of seniors that "the
church's priority is people before projects." He suggested that illnesses,
surgeries, etc. should be reported to the church office. The information would
be followed up with a telephone call from the pastor who would pray with them
and assure them that their plight would be drawn to the attention of the church
through the Sunday bulletin. "I am very busy," he went on to say, "but if you
are seriously ill, I will try to find time to visit you in the hospital." <br>
<br>
 Following the meeting, Viola spoke with the pastor. "Pastor," she said, "I
wrote an article for a magazine, and in it I indicated that when I am ill, I do
not want to see the pastor." The pastor tried to hide his shock at such a
statement. Continued Viola, "I far prefer seeing my pastor when I am at home,
where we can have a good chat together, share a chuckle, and find out how
things are going at the church. I don't want to see my pastor when I am
nauseous, under medication, looking like a hag, and feeling half-dead."
(Excerpts from Viola's article are printed below.)<br>
<br>
 
<center><font color="green">Please, pastor, if I promise to be real good and
not go to the hospital<br>
for the next ten years, will you visit me in my home instead?</font></center>
<br>
<br>
 
<center>
<div class="title2">HOSPITAL HAZARDS</div>
<div class="author">(by Viola Pahl)</div>
</center>
<br>
 I, personally, do NOT want to see a pastor when I'm wilting away in my
hospital bed. Vanity tells me that I look gruesome; my pain is overwhelming;
and my speech incoherent through medication. So if my pastor's policy is to
visit only when one is near death's door - I hope he stays away for a long,
long time. I don't need the reminder.<br>
<br>
 
<center><img alt="112" src="hospital_112.gif"></center>
<br>
<br>
 Of course, I need him when there is a death or serious family problems. But if
I have to be sick or in trouble just to see my pastor face to face, forget it.
Surely there must be a time once in awhile for a pastor to visit someone when
that someone is articulate, can talk with him about many mutual issues, pray
for him, and encourage him. As for other visitors, I am reluctant to have
anyone visit with me. No offence. I know that my friends would do their best to
be an encouragement. However, it is for <i>their</i> protection they should
stay away. Why should they want to visit a miserable, self-pitying, bed-ridden,
disheveled-looking old lady? I try to be nice when I'm hospitalized, but
because of the added problem of polio, my four major surgeries have not been
fun times.<br>
<br>
 With the exception of a private room, remember the ward contains people who
are complete strangers, suddenly brought together through the common bond of
suffering. Visitors need to observe hospital etiquette. If your friend does not
have a medical problem which causes him severe illness (i.e. a broken leg), he
is able to enjoy visitors. A sprightly lady with a minor ailment in my ward
exercised her tongue most of the day in loud enough tones for the "deaf" lady
next to her to enjoy the conversation. When it was visiting time, her visitors
joined in with boisterous talk and laughter. On the first few days following
surgery, I didn't even register on a scale of 1 to 10. I was a ZERO! A complete
wipe-out! The loud talk, the loud laughs, and the loud movements of furniture,
caused me severe discomfort. <br>
<br>
 When your pastor visits, he will doubtless offer a prayer, and it is likely
that others in the ward will hear him. He should remember he is ministering to
<i>his</i> member - it is not a time to preach an evangelistic message in the
prayer, hoping to witness to others in the ward. "What is needed is not a
pastor who is the source of all wisdom and the fount of all knowledge, but one
who will be a sympathetic listener, and let the patient set the agenda.
Understanding, acceptance, and love will take you a long way in a hospital
ward," commented a pastor.<br>
<br>
 What is the cause of illness? A man who had tripped on the sidewalk was
hospitalized for a broken leg. The deacon asserted, "Brother, this is of the
devil." The pastor exclaimed, "Brother, this is for the glory of God." When the
man's wife visited, she chided, "You clumsy idiot. Why did you have to fall
over your feet and bring this on yourself?" In addition to theological
dissertations on the mystery of suffering, a patient often gets big doses of
futile clich&eacute;s. A particularly irritating clich&eacute; is, "There are
many who are a lot worse than you." (True, but there are thousands who are much
better!) (See my link on HEALING for further comments.)<br>
<br>
 Exercise wisdom when bringing food and flowers to the hospital. Unfortunately
for me, the scent of flowers or perfume in a small room is a hazard. Even in
church, many people are "over-perfumed." I have had to move from my pew when a
highly-scented person sat in front of me. Although I am able to relocate to
another pew in church, I am unable to change the location of my hospital bed.
Would it not be better to send these loving gifts to the patient's home AFTER
he/she has left the hospital? When I arrived home from the hospital, I phoned
the church office and said with a chuckle, "You can now take my name off the
endangered species list. God has restored my health sufficiently so that I need
no longer be mentioned in the bulletin." <br>
<br>
 Although I had a NO VISITORS sign hung in my hospital room, you won't find it
around our home. Here, the sign reads VISITORS WELCOME! Any time. Any day. Yes,
a potted plant without too much scent will be gladly received. Remember, the
fragrance of Christ is IN us, not ON us! Resist the temptation to splash a
little more cologne on your lapel! My husband, having subsisted on fried eggs
while I was hospitalized, will be grateful for your thoughtfulness in bringing
a delicious casserole. When you enter my domain, expect a huge dose of
medicine. No matter how decrepit my body becomes, a "cheerful heart does good
like medicine" (Proverbs 17:22 TLB), and I will share my joy in the Lord with
you - it will NOT be hazardous to your health! <i>Guaranteed!</i><br>

<center>This has to be about the best joke - with a not-so-funny ending -<br>
 I've heard for a long time:</center>
<br>
<br>
 The family called the minister to the hospital because Joe, the grandfather of
the home, was dying. After gathering around the bedside, they noticed that
Joe's condition was worsening. Unable to speak, he motioned for paper and pencil. The pastor carried a small notebook in his jacket pocket, and he gave it to Joe who immediately scribbled a message. Because Joe started to struggle for more breath, the pastor was detracted from reading the written message, and he quickly put the notebook back in his pocket to see if he could help the dying man. After a matter of minutes, Joe went home to be with the Lord. <br>
<br>
 Following his message at Joe's funeral, the pastor suddenly realized that he
was wearing the same jacket he had worn in the hospital. "One more thing,"
exclaimed the minister. "Just before he passed away, Joe wrote a short message.
I have it here. I'm sure it will contain inspiration for all of us." When the
pastor took out the notepad, he suddenly turned white and nearly collapsed at
the podium. <br>
