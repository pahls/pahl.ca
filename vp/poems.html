<center>Bound to bring a few chuckles are some of the poems<br>
and readings Viola has collected or written over the
years.</center>
<br>
<br>
 
<center>Fred's first language was German. Throughout the years,
we have been<br>
with many German-speaking people. Here is a sample of some of
the<br>
English/German readings Viola has composed.</center>
<br>

<div class="title">AN ENGLISHMAN'S DILEMMA</div>
</center>
<br>
 For many months I have honestly tried to learn the German
language, but to no avail.<br>
<br>
 Meine guten Freude, how do you expect an Englishman's tongue to
get around such words as:<br>
<br>
<div class="indent">Freund-schafts-be-zeigungen<br>
 Stadt-ver-ordneten-versamm-lungen<br>
 General-staats-verordneten-ver-sammlungen (37 letters!)<br>
 Alter-thums-wissen-schaften</div>
<br>
 In German, a young lady has no sex, while a turnip has. See how
this sounds:<br>
<br>
 Gretchen: Wilhelm, where is the turnip?<br>
Wilhelm: SHE has gone to the kitchen. (Die Steckrube ist in die
Kuche gegangen)<br>
Gretchen: Where is the accomplished and beautiful English
maiden?<br>
Wilhelm: IT has gone to the opera. (Es ist in die Oper
gegangen)<br>
<br>
 A tree is male; its buds are female; its leaves are neuter.<br>
<br>
 A person's mouth, neck, elbows, fingers, nails, feet, and body
are of the male sex.<br>
 (Der Mund, der Hals, Der Ellbogen, der Finger, der Nagel, der
Fuss)<br>
<br>
 In Germany all the women wear male heads!<br>
<br>
 A person's nose, lips, shoulders, hands and toes are of the
female sex! (Die Nase, die Lippen, die Schulter)<br>
<br>
 His hair, ears, eyes, chin, legs, knees, heart, and conscience
haven't any sex at all! (das Haar, das Ohr, das Kinn, das Bein,
das Knie)<br>
<br>
 This explains why it is so hard for an English person to learn
the wonderful German language. Probably the best way to help our
poor tongues would be to take a trip to Germany.<br>
<br>
 If I ever take a trip to Germany, I shall look for the first
checking station and hand over my English tongue for safekeeping
until I leave for home.<br>
<br>
 Wenn ich mal die Gelegenheit habe nach Deutschland zu fahren,
werde ich die erste Gepackaufbewahrungs-stelle aufsuchen und
meine kostbare englische zunge abgeben bis ich wieder nach Hause
fahre.<br>
<br>
 Then I shall try out one of those German tongues and see if it
will help me to get around such words as
Freund-schafts-be-zei-gungen. But I'm afraid - even with trying
out a German tongue, people will look at me mit Verzweiflung,
throw up their hands, and say: "Wie schrecklich! Wie
Schrecklich!"<br>

<div class="title">JONAH and the WHALE</div>
</center>
<br>
<center>Now listen, my friends, and I'll tell you a tale,<br>
 How old Jonah the prophet got caught by the whale.<br>
The whale caught poor Jonah and, bless your dear soul,<br>
He not only caught him, but swallowed him whole.<br>
A part of this story is awfully sad,<br>
It is how a big city went to the bad,<br>
When the Lord saw those people with such wicked ways,<br>
He said, "I can't stand them more 'n forty more days!"<br>
<br>
 He spoke to old Jonah and said, "Go and cry<br>
To those hard hearted people and tell them that I<br>
Give them forty days more to get humbled down,<br>
And if they don't do it, I'll tear up their town."<br>
Jonah heard the Lord speaking and he said, "No,<br>
That's against my religion, and I won't go.<br>
Those Nineveh people mean nothing to me,<br>
And I'm against foreign missions, you see."<br>
<br>
 He went down to Joppa and there, in great haste,<br>
He boarded a ship for a different place;<br>
The Lord looked down on that ship and said He,<br>
"Old Jonah is fixing to run off from me."<br>
He set the wind blowing with squeaks and with squeals,<br>
And the sea got rowdy and kicked up its heels;<br>
Old Jonah confessed it was all for his sin;<br>
The crew threw him out, and the whale took him in.<br>
<br>
 The whale said, "Old fellow, don't you forget,<br>
I am sent here to take you in out of the wet,<br>
You will get punished aright for your sin,"<br>
So he opened his mouth, and poor Jonah went in.<br>
On beds of green seaweed that fish tried to rest,<br>
He said, "I will sleep while my food I digest."<br>
But he got mighty restless and sorely afraid,<br>
And he rumbled inside as the old prophet prayed.<br>
<br>
 The third day that fish rose up from his bed<br>
With his stomach tore up and a pain in his head;<br>
He said, "I must get to the air mighty quick,<br>
For this wicked backslider is making me sick."<br>
He winked his big eyes and wiggled his tail<br>
And pulled for the shore to deliver his male;<br>
He stopped near the shore and looked all around,<br>
And spewed old Jonah right up on the ground.<br>
<br>
 Poor Jonah thanked God for His mercy and grace,<br>
And turning around to the whale made a face.<br>
He said, "After three days I guess you have found<br>
A good man, old fellow, is hard to keep down."<br>
He stretched himself out with a yawn and a sigh<br>
And sat down in the sun for his clothing to dry;<br>
He thought how much better his preaching would be,<br>
Since from Whale Seminary he had a degree.<br>
<br>
 When he had rested and dried in the sun,<br>
He started for Nineveh, right on the run;<br>
He thanked his dear Father in heaven above<br>
For His tender mercy and wonderful love.<br>
And though he was nearly three days late,<br>
He preached from the time he entered the gate,<br>
Till the whole population repented and prayed.<br>
And by God's great mercy, His vengeance was stayed.<br>
<br>
 Now friends, when you disobey, remember this tale,<br>
When you run from God's call, look out for the whale;<br>
Wherever God calls you is the place you should go,<br>
And He will go with you His Word tells you so.<br>

<br>
 NOTE:<br>
The whale was a great personal worker:<br>
&bull; He was called of God<br>
&bull; He was in the right place at the right time<br>
&bull; He got his man.</center>

<div class="title">HOW TO COOK A HUSBAND</div>
</center>
<br>
 A good many husbands are entirely spoiled by mismanagement in
cooking and are not so tender and good. Some women keep them in
hot water; others freeze them; and others keep them constantly in
a pickle. It cannot be supposed that husbands will be good and
tender if they are managed this way. However, if properly
treated, they are delicious!<br>
<br>
 If you do not want to learn how to cook him properly, it would
be better to have no husband. It does not make so much difference
what you cook him in as how you cook him. Don't keep him in the
pan by force as he will stay there himself if proper care is
taken. If he splutters or fizzes, do not be anxious; some
husbands do this. Add a little sugar in the form of what
confectioners call "kisses," but no vinegar or pepper on any
account. A little spice improves him, but it must be used with
care. Do not try him with anything sharp to see if he is becoming
tender. Stir him gently lest he stay too long in the pan and
become flat and tasteless. If treated in this way, you will find
him very digestible, and he will agree very well with you.<br>

<div class="title">BURGLAR BILL</div>
<br>
 I'll sing you a song of Burglar Bill - who tried to rob a
house.<br>
He opened a window and crept right in - as quiet as a mouse.<br>
He said to himself, "I'll hide away 'til everyone is asleep.<br>
Then quick as a flash, I'll take the cash, and out of the house
I'll creep."<br>
<br>
 So he hid himself right under the bed, hard up against the
wall.<br>
But he hadn't a clue who owned the place - or he'd never have
stayed at all.<br>
He never thought - well, he never knew - as under the bed he
lay,<br>
That in the night he'd get a fright that would turn his hair to
grey.<br>
<br>
 At nine o'clock the owner came in. "I'm tired as can be," she
said.<br>
And figuring that all was right well - she didn't look under the
bed.<br>
She took out her teeth and her old glass eye, and the hair from
off her head.<br>
And Burglar Bill turned icy cold with panic beneath the bed.<br>
<br>
 Well, he waited for hours - then out he crept. He felt a total
wreck.<br>
But the old maid - she was still awake, and she grabbed him by
the neck!<br>
She never screamed or fainted away, but calm as any clam<br>
She said: "My prayers are answered. Oh! Thank heaven! I've found
a man!"<br>
<br>
 She whipped a revolver from under the pillow and to the burglar
said:<br>
"Young fellow, you'll have to marry me now - or I'll blow off the
top of your head!"<br>
<br>
 Poor Bill looked at her teeth and heaved a sigh...<br>
At the ghastly wig and the old glass eye...<br>
The coy little smile...the provocative pose,<br>
And the vericose veins on the end of her nose.<br>
<br>
 With evil grin she aimed her gun; there wasn't a chance to
scoot.<br>
In desperation the burglar cried: "Lady! I implore you! <font
color="red">SHOOT</font>!"</center>

<div class="title">PETE AND ME</div>
</center>
<br>
 A little boy is being punished, and the punishment is that he
has to stay indoors for two weeks. As the scene opens, he is
calling out from his window to a playmate.<br>
<br>
<center>Hoo - Hoo - can you come over a little while and
play?<br>
You see, I'm being punished and can't go out today.<br>
If you can't come inside - can't you come to the gate?<br>
You see, I'm in for two whole weeks.<br>
(Pauses) Awwww - let your errand wait.<br>
<br>
 Sure, I'll tell you how it was - I'd just as soon as not.<br>
I didn't think it was so bad - but just look what I got.<br>
You know when that Convention was here a week ago?<br>
And that preacher who stayed here and was so bald, you know?<br>
<br>
 Well, Peter Ramsey, he was here one night to play with me,<br>
And all the folks had gone to church, and we looked 'round to
see<br>
What we could do to have some fun, and Peter knew a trick,<br>
Which, if you can work it right, sure is awful slick.<br>
<br>
 You take the things all off the bed - except the middle
slat,<br>
Then put them back all balanced, nice, and looking smooth and
flat.<br>
And it works just like a teeter if you touch the head or
foot,<br>
But if you're very careful, it stays just like it's put.<br>
We fixed it up, then played around until the folks came home,<br>
And we just looked at picture books and waited till they
come.<br>
<br>
 The preacher - he was awful warm - and took a seat outside<br>
In the biggest rocker so comf'table and wide.<br>
He sat so still, he fell asleep, and Peter and I were there,<br>
And we both had nice wads of gum.<br>
 And Peter - I declare, Can think up just the nicest things,
though mother don't agree.<br>
<br>
 Well, he leaned over to be close and whispered soft to me,<br>
And we crept up behind his chair - the preacher's chair, I
mean,<br>
And his bald head did look so nice, all shiny, white and
clean.<br>
So we stretched the sticky gum all out into a nice, long
string,<br>
And made a map right on his head as nice as anything.<br>
<br>
 Then Peter - he went home - and left me all alone,<br>
And you might know I'd get the blame - I always am the one.<br>
That preacher made an awful fuss, and if you didn't know,<br>
You'd never guess that he was one, the way he acted so.<br>
He got real mad - exactly like just ordinary folks.<br>
I never thought a preacher would get so mad at jokes.<br>
<br>
 Well, mother got the kerosene and worked and worked and
worked,<br>
And I just wish you could have seen the way he jerked, and jerked
and jerked.<br>
And after he was all fixed up and started off to bed,<br>
I told him I was sorry, just like my mother said.<br>
<br>
 But just when the house got quiet, there came an awful
crash,<br>
I had forgot about the bed until I heard it smash.<br>
He simply wasn't careful when he climbed into bed,<br>
And when he did, the springs tipped up, and dumped him on his
head.<br>
<br>
 I'm most ashamed to tell it, but it's true, I do declare,<br>
That preacher - almost nearly - sweared an awful swear!<br>
<br>
 Then father came into my room, and closed and locked the
door.<br>
And said real loud, I'VE STOOD ENOUGH AND CANNOT STAND MUCH
MORE."<br>
And then he spoke up awful cross, a-whackin' mighty hard,<br>
And said, "FOR PUNISHMENT, YOU'LL STAY TWO WEEKS IN THE
YARD."<br>
And then he turned and winked at me and slipped a quarter,
too.<br>
If it wasn't for my father, I don't know what I'd do.<br>
<br>
 But just the same, I'm staying in. "TO KEEP PEACE," father
said.<br>
But boy! I wish I'd seen that preacher standin' on his head!<br>
