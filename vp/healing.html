This photo was taken about 1952 in front of the Grace Baptist Church,<br>
Medicine Hat, at a conference.  Pictured are pastors and church officials.<br>
Viola had an old wooden wheelchair on loan from the Red Cross.<br>
It was difficult at times to be the only physically disabled<br>
in a world of able-bodied people.<br>
How could God use someone with so little to offer to others?<br></center>

<div class="title">WHAT IS HEALING?</div>
</center>

<br>
 I do not intend to get into the theological ramifications of healing - I will
leave that to the brilliant theologians of our day. Sufficient to say, there
are many different views expressed in the various denominations represented by
my readers. The following thoughts express my own personal experiences in the
realm of healing. They are not written to formulate a doctrine, attack people's
views who may differ, or set myself up as an authority. By sharing our views,
instead of being confrontational, we can learn from each other. A short Bible
verse which has a wealth of meaning is the following from 1 Timothy 6:6:<br>
<br>
 
<center><font color="blue">GODLINESS WITH CONTENTMENT IS GREAT
GAIN</font></center>

<br>
 I don't ask WHY ME, LORD, WHY ME? As I have noted in my books, the WHY
syndrome is usually a WHINE syndrome. It is a one-way street - you'll never
find the answer.<br>
<br>
 In 1949, after eight months of hospitalization and no end in sight, I found
life to be boring and aimless. What could a future hold for someone like me? In
another ward was a fine Christian lady who was paralyzed from the waist down.
Hundreds of people were praying for her, whereas my scope of friends was far
less. If God answers prayer solely on the basis of "quantity" of people who
pray, then Janice had a head start on me. One day her parents visited me,
excitement gleaming in their eyes. "This will be the last time we will be
visiting you," they exclaimed. "We are taking Janice out of the hospital
because God is going to heal her." Miracles do happen - tumors shrink; people
walk again; cancer disappears - so I was elated to think that these people had
faith to believe in total healing for their daughter.<br>
<br>
 I finally was discharged, barely able to walk a few steps with crutches, but
as time went on, I continued to improve. I never received complete healing, but
I certainly accomplished many things in life which were miracles in themselves.
One day a letter arrived from Janice's parents. To their dismay, the
anticipated miracle did not happen - Janice was not improving - nor did she
ever show improvement throughout the years. They enquired as to what I had done
to achieve more mobility. I can offer no particular reason as to why Janice
remained immobile while I acquired a fair amount of mobility.<br>
<br>
 Throughout the earlier years in my new life with polio, it was suggested many
times to me that I should attend "healing" meetings. I attended one big
campaign, but I did not go to the front for healing. One of our church members
who went to the front did not receive the healing he desired. Others seemingly
did.<br>
<br>
 A most interesting encounter occurred when we were on holidays in Banff
National Park. We went to a store-front church meeting, and although we never
did find out with which denomination the group was affiliated, we immediately
knew that the preacher was a charismatic-type of person. The thought filtered
through me: "I am the only one in the congregation with a visible handicap. I
wonder if I will be singled out?" Sure enough, as we filed out the door, the
preacher shook everyone's hand, and when it was my turn, he said in rather
pontifical tones: "Sister&hellip; (and he touched my crutches) God doesn't
intend for you to have crutches."<br>
<br>
 I had not thought of an answer beforehand. I had never heard any illustration
given in the past which may have triggered my type of answer. Without a
hesitation, my response came out loud and clear.<br>
<br>
 "Sir," I responded. "I perceive that you are wearing glasses. You have
'crutches' for your eyes. I have 'crutches' for my legs." With that repartee, I
left the preacher with his eyes and mouth wide open, and I walked out. Fred,
who had gone out sooner, observed the scenario, but had not heard the
conversation. "What did you say to that man to cause him to look like that?"
Fred asked. (We wonder if the preacher went home and broke his glasses -
trusting the Lord to heal his eyes completely.)<br>
<br>
 Some of my thinking regarding healing appeared in CHRISTIAN WEEK magazine.<br>
<br>
 
<center>THESE ARE DAYS OF MIRACLES AND WONDERS<br>
Shining character matters more than bright teeth<br>
<div class="author">EDITORIAL by Doug Koop, Editor,<br>
CHRISTIAN WEEK, March 30, 1999 - Canada's Christian News Source<br>
Published in Winnipeg, MB Copyrighted</div>
</center>

<br>
 Tyrell Dueck's fate is back in the hands of God. Not that it was ever really
anywhere else, but at least the soft-spoken 13-year-old with the gentle smile
won't be forced to undergo chemotherapy and have his leg amputated. Unless God
intervenes with a healing miracle or alternative therapies work wondrous magic,
however, a rare cancer is expected to claim his life within a year. For a
riveting three weeks in March, Dueck's struggle to determine his own course of
treatment surfaced a host of legal, ethical and religious issues and captured
the attention of the national press. And flitting about the fringes of the
debate was the matter of faith and the prospect of divine healing. If ever
there was a candidate for a miracle, Dueck fits the bill. His personal courage,
gracious manner and stalwart faith stood up well under pressure. But before bad
news of spreading cancer halted the proceedings, professions had determined
that conventional treatment was in young Tyrell's best interests,
notwithstanding his apparent belief that he will be healed by God.<br>
<br>
 <u>Divine Dentistry</u>? Wonders and miracles of a rather lesser order are
being reported once again at the Toronto Airport Christian Fellowship, where
notions of divine dentistry are raising quite a buzz. "Why should God fill
people's teeth with gold?" asks a TACF press release. The proffered answers are
vague. "Perhaps because He loves them and delights in blessing His children.
Perhaps it is a sign and a wonder to expose the skepticism still in so many of
us. Perhaps His glory and presence are drawing near." Perhaps. But this latest
expression of the Toronto Blessing seems a trivial pursuit. Certainly the
prospect of receiving physical and material benefits appeals powerfully to our
human nature and no doubt God understands that these things are very important
to us. At times he is even willing to indulge us. But other things matter
more.<br>
<br>
 <u>Viola Pahl</u>, a polio survivor who uses crutches or a wheelchair,
recently shared a story of an incident that occurred when she and her preacher
husband wandered into an unfamiliar church in a vacation spot. As the meeting
progressed, she sensed she would be invited to throw away the crutches. Sure
enough, as she was filing out after the service, the preacher patted her
shoulder and said, "Sister, God did not intend for you to have crutches." Her
reply spilled out spontaneously. "Sir, I perceive you are wearing glasses. You
have a crutch for your eyes; I have crutches for my legs." And without further
ado, she sailed past him.<br>
<br>
 <u>Pahl</u>, who has written a book called <i>Through the Iron Lung</i>,
understands all too well that some infirmities are more major and limiting than
others. And she does not disallow the possibility of miraculous divine healing.
But she has some perspective to offer as well. "God has wrought many miracles
in my life - courage, acceptance, contentment, faith in the sovereign will of
God and so on. How come no-one heralds these things as miracles? Given my basic
personality, I would never have made it with my physical infirmity without the
great miracles God has done in and through my life."<br>
<br>
 The ability to honor God with obedience and unwavering belief in adversity -
to allow one's very character to be truly transformed - is an act of faith and
worship. Earlier this decade, tennis great Arthur Ashe (who was also highly
respected for his courage and grace as a social activist) revealed to the world
that he had AIDS (almost surely acquired through contaminated blood). In his
1993 autobiography, Days of Grace, Ashe addressed the question of how to pray
in the face of a disease.<br>
<br>
 "If I don't ask 'why me?' after my victories, I cannot ask 'why me?' after my
setbacks and disaster," he wrote. "I also do not waste time pleading with God
to make me well. I was brought up to believe that prayer is not to be invoked
to ask God for things for oneself or even for others. Rather, prayer is a
medium through which I ask God to show me God's will, and to give me the
strength to carry out that will."<br>
<br>
 Whether God can or cannot, will or will not, perform miracles is not really
the issue. Rather, we might ask what kind of wonders mature Christians should
be looking for. We can rejoice in every miracle of authentic healing that takes
place. In the end, however, shining character matters more than bright teeth,
and a healthy relationship with God matters more than a healthy body.<br>

Within one week, the above activities were completely wiped out of my life
forever. I write this so that you will focus attention on the thousands of
young people who have lost this part of living through accidents, and other
debilitating afflictions such as cerebral palsy, spina befida, etc. In my case,
I was able to do all of the above before I got polio. In other cases, the
person never was able to do sports activities.<br>
<br>
 I won a swimming scholarship to the one and only prestigious club in Vancouver
which trained the Olympic athletes. The lady who coached my diving skills was a
former Olympian participant. I was not of Olympic caliber, but the training
made me a very strong swimmer. Following polio, I was still able to swim and
enjoy water therapy with confidence.<br>
<br>
 At high school, I won the high-jump championship one year. I could hardly walk
for days afterwards I was so stiff from the accelerated energy required for the
event.<br>
<br>
 As mentioned in the link entitled IRON LUNGS - WHEELCHAIRS, hiking up Grouse
Mountain was always a highlight. In the winter time, we rented skis and enjoyed
skiing immensely. I, however, did land on time in a heap at the bottom of a
steep hill and had to be helped down the mountain due to twisting muscles in my
leg.<br>
<br>
 Cycling? I went everywhere on a bike. In our era, very few young people had
cars. With a girlfriend, we undertook cycling holidays which involved hundreds
of miles. My mother never liked the idea of my having a bicycle, but because I
was earning my own money at age 15, she allowed me to buy a bike, and the rest
is history. Fred and I even took our bikes on our honeymoon.<br>
<br>
<center><img src="heal_123.gif" alt="123"></center>

<br>
 
<center>The BIG question: Can you have all these wonderful activities<br>
taken from you and still be CONTENT?<br>
<br>
 YES! YES! YES! - IT'S GOD'S MIRACLE!</center>

<br>
<br>
<br>
 
<center>EMPLOYMENT</center>

<br>
 Would I ever be able to work again? I had secretarial skills - but who would
want a disabled secretary? Because Fred's desire was to obtain higher
education, I went job hunting so he could fulfill his dream.<br>
<br>
 My first job back into the work force was with the Provincial Government. I
was selected to be the first secretary to the two men who had been appointed by
the Government to work out a hospital-insurance plan for the citizens of
Alberta. After several years, Fred's ministry led him to Saskatchewan, and I
was not working out at that time. However, I was able to keep up my secretarial
skills. In that long-ago era, there were no secretaries hired for churches, so
I ran off the bulletins, typed out reports for the various church departments,
etc.<br>
<br>
 We returned to Edmonton, and again, I sought employment. There was an opening
to be secretary to the medical doctor who was head of the Provincial Health
Units and the immunization program. I loved working with medical terminology. I
then placed my name on the roster for part-time secretarial help, and from time
to time, I worked in interesting and varied departments of the government. One
day I was called to fill in for one of the Premier's secretaries who was
relocating. This eventually led to my working in the correspondence office of
Premier Lougheed (in the 1970's).<br>
<br>
 We moved to Vancouver Island in 1977, and I applied for work at a local
college in Nanaimo. I was hired on a part-time basis for secretarial work in
the library. However, in time, I applied for a relief instructor position in
Business Administration. I was hired - and I loved my job.<br>
<br>
<center>Herein is the MIRACLE:<br>
Please understand that by now I was age 56<br>
Please understand that I was still physically disabled and even required<br>
 a wheelchair at times<br>
Please understand that my educational resume read "finished Grade Ten"<br>
Please understand that I had nothing in my resume which stated<br>
that I had teaching experience in my background<br>
<br>
 I WAS HIRED!<br>
<br>
 The students told me that I was the best relief instructor they ever had.<br>
I was taken out for a dinner by the students - it had never been done
before.<br>
When students I taught - only on a part-time basis - were ready<br>
for graduation, they asked me to be their guest speaker.</center>

<br>
<br>
<br>
 
<center>THE MIRACLES OF A HAPPY MARRIAGE</center>

<br>
 As of May 2004, we have been married 58 years! So many marriages have been
dissolved because of one spouse becoming disabled. The partnership just
couldn't stand the strain of the ensuing problems encountered. It is an
absolute MIRACLE that we were able to stand the stress and emotional upheaval
of having our lives turned upside down when I got polio. Everything changed:
our plans to go to China as missionaries were shattered. Would Fred ever
realize his dreams to be a minister? Yes, his dreams came true. How "normal"
would our world be? Well, we have been so blessed to have had happy years
together. And at the present time, so many of our friends have lost their
spouse - and we are still around. Now, I shouldn't joke, but I have to commend
Fred for being a marriage survivor. Having said that, you cannot help but
believe in miracles when you think of what he has had to put up with! (See my
link: MY FAVOURITE VALENTINE.)<br>
<br>
<br><br>
 
<center>MIRACLES OF MONETARY STABILITY</center>

<center><img alt="124" src="heal_124.gif"></center>

<br>
 Probably the highest income we ever had was about $35,000 a year. Preachers'
salaries in earlier years were extremely low, and there were no "perks" with
the salary. There was no allowance made for gas mileage, book purchases,
hospitality allowance, educational seminars, and so forth. In fact, from 1949
to 1966, we supplied our own ditto and/or mimeograph machine for the church,
plus paper. (Having said this - we wouldn't exchange those years for anything
else - God was with us!) However, in retirement years, we have been blessed
with comfortable lodging. As you may have noted elsewhere in some of the links,
the gorgeous sunset views from our condo are fantastic. Fred's gift of good
money management has made it possible to live so comfortably. <br>
<br>
<br>
 
<center>MIRACLES OF WORLD-WIDE TRAVEL</center>

<br>
 Even with such low incomes, Fred has been able to travel to 39 different
countries. Now, the way he travels may not be the way you would want to travel.
He really "roughed" it at times to accommodate a limited budget. But I felt so
good when he took off on a trip, for I felt I had not hindered him in realizing
some of his dreams.<br>
<br>
 But wait a minute - I was also able to travel. In 1952 with a salary of $1800
a year, we purchased a trailer for $1900. The trailer made it possible for me
to be at summer camps, and also to have holidays which were not too expensive.
We saved as much as we could and paid back the money to a friend, who was kind
enough to loan us the money without interest. In our trailer (later exchanged
for a motorhome), we went to church conferences in St. Paul, Minnesota; Waco,
Texas; Sacramento, California; various Canadian cities. We were able to holiday
in such magnificent spots as Banff, various lake resorts, Whistler, Porteau
Cove. <br>
<br>
 Our daughter Susan spent four years in Japan. During that time, I was
selected, along with other handicapped adults, to go on a trip to Japan. There,
we visited many rehabilitation centers. What a glorious trip it was, made all
the more special because I was in the area where our daughter was teaching and
could spend several days with her. The Canadian Consulate in Tokyo hosted the
group for an afternoon.<br>
<br>
 And then, Susan moved on to Australia. Thanks to "free mile" bonus points
earned by our son, he gifted us with a trip to Australia, and we had a
marvelous time there. We've been a number of times to Hawaii. And an elderly
lady who wanted to go on an Alaskan boat cruise, asked me to be her companion
for the trip. <br>
<br>
 
<center>MIRACLES? YOU BET!<br>
<br>
<br>
 EMOTIONAL, PSYCHOLOGICAL, SPIRITUAL MIRACLES</center>

<br>
 Adjusting to a new way of life attacks you from every part of your being: your
personality, your character, your emotions, your spirituality, your lifestyle.
It is a challenge of momentous transformation. The first three years were
difficult. Thoughts of worthlessness creep into your thinking:<br>
<center>What kind of a wife am I with this handicap?<br>
Will I be able to bring up my children properly?<br>
I can't even scrub a floor - what good am I?<br>
I have to be served in so many ways, and I can't repay the favors.<br>
God is punishing me for the things I have done wrong.<br>
I can't serve God as effectively with a disability.<br>
And many disabled people have thought about suicide<br>
because they don't want to be a burden.</center>

<br>
 Look - when you see that God has brought people through adverse circumstances
and that they can still praise the Lord in spite of it all, you have to believe
in <br>
<br>
 
<center>MIRACLES!</center>

<br>
 Yes, it is a miracle when someone is healed. But I make the argument - it also
a miracle to be sustained when everything goes wrong. This inner strength to
live above the challenges of a disability is a <br>
<br>
<center>MIRACLE!</center>

<br>
 I could go on and on. Yes, it is a miracle when a person using crutches for
years is healed, and he/she throws the crutches in the air and walks normally
again. But I maintain that having a handicap and living a life filled with the
joy of the Lord is also a miracle.<br>
<br>
<center>Share your opinions with me:<br>
viola@pahl.ca<br>
<br>
 The topic of healing is never-ending.<br>
In this submission, we have just skimmed the surface.</center>

<br>
<br>
 
<center>WHO IS RESPONSIBLE FOR AFFLICTIONS?<br>
<br>
 You may have read this elsewhere in my links, but it bears repeating:<br>
 A man fell in his walkway and seriously injured his hip, leg, and back. A
deacon, the preacher, and the man's wife voiced various reasons as to why it
had happened.<br>
<br>
 DEACON: This tragedy is of the devil, my brother.<br>
PREACHER: This tragedy is for the glory of God, my brother.<br>
WIFE: You clumsy idiot. Why didn't you watch where you were going?<br>
<br>
 
<center><font color=red>Ah yes - the BIG question. WHO REALLY IS RESPONSIBLE?</FONT><br>
<font color=green>The devil?</font><br>
<font color=blue>God?</font><br>
<font color="#FF00FF">Or stupidity on our part?</font></center>

<br>
 
<center><img alt="125" src="heal_125.gif"></center>

<br>
<br>
<center>WHATEVER YOUR ANSWER IS,<br>
LET US GIVE GOD THE GLORY<br>
FOR HIS LOVE, GOODNESS, CARING ABIDE FOREVER!</center><br>
