<div class="title">INFORMATION REGARDING THE MUSICAL/DRAMA ENTITLED<br>
<br>
 &ldquo;GOD&rsquo;S AMAZING ALOHA OF LOVE&rdquo;</div>
</center>
<br>
<br>
 The material for this musical/drama was assembled by Viola Pahl who lives in
White Rock, British Columbia, Canada (near Vancouver; two miles from the
Canadian - U.S. border at Blaine, WA). Viola and her husband Fred are retired
(Fred served as a Baptist minister for many years). In 1948, Viola contracted
polio when she was seven months&rsquo; pregnant. She spent several weeks in an
iron lung and has remained a paraplegic, using crutches and/or wheelchair. One
of her special ministries has been writing: skits, fun poetry, plays, and books
(which number seven). Although a paraplegic, Viola also worked from time to
time as a secretary, and in later years, as an instructor in Business
Administration at a college. She and her husband present innovative programs to
community organizations and adult groups at various churches. A newspaper article write-up on Viola is under the link IRON LUNGS AND 
WHEELCHAIRS.
<br>
<br>
 The steel guitar has a particular fascination for Viola, and she plays her
double-neck steel guitar for many functions. She has attended the Hawaiian
World-Wide Steel Guitar Association convention in Hawaii to hear the
world&rsquo;s best players. The more traditional type of hymns sounds beautiful
on the Hawaiian guitar. Many secular Hawaiian songs have a captivating rhythm
which will appeal to young and old alike. The lyrics of these songs have been
re-written by Viola Pahl to suit a Christian context. Please feel free to
contact Viola at the addresses shown below.<br>

<center>
<div class="title">SUGGESTIONS</div>
</center>
<br>
 1. PRELUDE<br>
Instead of your regular prelude, why not play a tape of Hawaiian music? If you
do not have a tape of this type of music, Viola may be able to help you
out.<br>
<br>
 2. DRAMA<br>
 a. Characters: Two actors are required: a man (Allan) and a woman (Linda)
acting as a married couple who are leaving on a vacation for Hawaii. If the
Musical/Drama is presented by seniors, then the occasion for the vacation could
be a fiftieth wedding anniversary; if younger adult groups present the program,
the reason for the holiday could be a twenty-fifth wedding anniversary, or even
a honeymoon. In Section One, the couple is wearing casual clothing before their
trip to Hawaii. In the remaining sections, the couple wears typical Hawaiian
attire. <br>
<br>
 b. Props: Eight suitcases - one small one for Allan; seven for Linda<br>
 Hawaiian clothing and leis for Linda and Allan<br>
 Two patio-type chairs and a small patio table are required for several of the
scenes.<br>
The couple will sip juice from tall colored glasses from time to time. If the
glasses are colored, there need not be any liquid in the glasses - the audience
will be none the wiser.<br>
 An outdoor patio umbrella if your platform has room for it.<br>
<br>
 c. Choir:<br>
The choir would look nice dressed in Hawaiian clothing, plus leis. <br>
<br>
 3. NARRATION<br>
 At times, Linda and Allan are the designated speakers. At other times, a
Narrator may be used. Or, more speakers can alternate in speaking the short
snippets of information. A variety of voices gives opportunity for more
participants and also keeps the audience interested. The information snippets
are not designated in most instances as to the speaker/s - the choice will be
yours.<br>
<br>
 4. ALTERNATIVES<br>
 This musical/drama is so designed that parts of it can be deleted without
spoiling the effect. It will depend on the length of time you have as to the
number of items you wish to use. Different songs than the designated ones can
be used.<br>
<br>
 5. CHOREOGRAPHY - Notes from Viola Pahl:<br>
 I taught drama at a Christian school in Nanaimo, and we presented a Christmas
program based on a Hawaiian theme. For one of the songs, we learned how to
"sign language" a verse. It is amazing how "sign language" can look like the
gestures in a hula dance. At the end of the program, various people were
thanked for their help, and the principal of the school was given a tribute.
These people were called to the platform, and following the tributes, they were
adorned with a lei.<br>
<br>
The pastor's wife of an Indonesian church in Vancouver choreographed body
movements to fit some of the words, and this was most effective. There are many
phrases in the songs which lend themselves to appropriate body movements by the
group. The body movements should be done in the style of hula. I have visited
several churches in Honolulu where they include in their services "Christian"
hula. "How Great Thou Art" is one hymn which has been done so beautifully and
worshipfully. Body movements should enhance, not distract from the message of
the song. The movements were slow, meaningful, and respectful - none of the
show-biz type hula was used. Doubtless there is someone in your group with the
imagination to "choreograph" a few graceful motions to enhance at least one
song.<br>
<br>
 6. LENGTH OF PROGRAM<br>
There is probably much more program material than you may wish to use. I have
deliberately printed a lot of information so that you can omit some of the
material and chose the material which you think is interesting for your
performers and audience.<br>
<br>
 7. CLOSING<br>
Following the closing benediction, have some of your choir members walk down
the aisles, shaking hands with people here and there, and saying, "Aloha."<br>
<br>

All alternative lyrics were composed by Viola Pahl<br>
 Often, verses can be sung together without repeating the chorus each time.<br>

<div class="black">Since this song/poem is at the beginning of the program,
here is a suggestion as to effectiveness: Have the women come down the aisle/s
from the back of the auditorium and work their way to the platform as the poem
progresses. The men are on the platform, along with the narrator of the poem.
Each section of the poem is prefaced by the singing of the following
phrase:<br>
<br>

 
<center><img alt="200" src="haw_200.gif" /></center>
<br>

 
<center>OPENING ALOHA:</center>
<br>

 Sing it three times: First by the ladies, next by the men, and then
altogether. Use this participation at the beginning and the ending of the poem.
In between the verses, the melodic phrase is sung once by everyone.<br>
<br>
 (Aloha by singers) 
<div class="indent">It's more than just an easy word for casual good-bye;<br>
 It's finer than a greeting, and it's sadder than a sigh;<br>

<br>
 (Aloha by singers) 
<div class="indent">It's all the tender messages that words cannot convey,<br>
 It's tears unshed, and longing for a loved one gone away;<br>
 It's welcome to Hawaii, and it's lingering farewell;<br>
 It's all the dear and silent things that lover's lips can tell;</div>
<br>
(Aloha by singers) 
<div class="indent">It's woven into flower leis and golden Hawaiian songs;<br>
 It's frailer than a spider-web and strong as leather thongs.<br>
 It's fresh as dew on ginger blooms and older than the moon;<br>

 NARRATOR: We are going to follow the vacation trip of Allan and Linda who are
leaving to take a vacation in Hawaii. As the scene opens, they are just about
ready to depart.<br>
<br>
 
<center>(Allan comes on stage with a small suitcase. He calls out):</center>

<br>
 ALLAN: Linda, are you coming? Time's running out. (He paces back and forth
impatiently; keeps looking at his watch) Women! It takes them a millennium to
get ready for a trip. Here I am - one suitcase - ready to go.<br>
<br>
 LINDA: (comes on stage, gasping for breath; carries two suitcases) Finally,
Allan, I'm ready. (places suitcases down)<br>
<br>
 ALLAN: It's about time. Let me take the suitcases, and you can lock the door.
(He picks up suitcases and staggers beneath the weight of them.) Linda! What
have you got in these suitcases? And why TWO suitcases? All you need in Hawaii
is a muu-muu!<br>
<br>
 LINDA: Sorry, Allan, but you'd have to be a woman to understand. (Allan starts
to leave with suitcases) By the way, Allan, I have five more suitcases, so
please come back for them.<br>
<br>
 ALLAN: You have what???? Can you tell me why you are taking SEVEN
suitcases?<br>
<br>
 LINDA: It's very simple. I have three suitcases for my personal belongings,
and I have four empty suitcases which I hope to fill up with lots of good
things from Hawaii for our children and grandchildren. And then there's Aunt
Mavis, Uncle Jim...<br>
<br>
 ALLAN: (interrupts) I've heard enough. Let's go. (shakes head ) No use arguing
with a woman. (takes out suitcases and returns for the empty ones)<br>
<br>
 LINDA: (Exclaims with joy while Allan is out; he comes on stage in time to
hear her last statement) Oh, I just can't wait to land in Hawaii! Balmy
breezes, guitars playing love songs, beautiful leis, Macadamia nuts&hellip;
Hawaii - here we come! (She exits as Allan speaks)<br>
<br>
 ALLAN: (grimly) Yeh - Hawaii, here we come. (Fumbles around in various pockets
for credit card - holds it in the air) With all the shopping Linda has planned,
no wonder they say, "Master Card - don't leave home without it!" (He goes
off-stage for the remaining suitcases.)<br>
<br>
 NARRATOR: Friends, we are all going on a vacation - and we won't have to take
any suitcases along. The choir will tell you all about it.<br>

and goes across the stage to the other exit.)<br>

 ALLAN: It's going to be difficult to go back home after the good time we're

some very interesting facts about Hawaii. Listen: Hawaii is the most isolated
population center on the face of the earth. It is over 2,000 miles from
California; over 3000 miles from Japan; over 5000 miles from the Philippines,
and nearly 5000 miles from China. There's more:<br>
<br>
 
<div class="indent">&bull; From east to west, Hawaii is the widest state in the
United States.<br><br>
&bull; In the 18th century, many imported animal species have had a negative
effect on the islands. These are: goats, cattle, sheep, pigs, and black rats.<br><br>
&bull; Hawaii is the only State in the USA that grows coffee.<br><br>
&bull; Hawaii had no mosquitoes until 1826, which were dumped ashore as the
sailors rinsed out water barrels.<br><br>
&bull; However, on the plus side - there are no mice, no deer, no raccoons,
 no buffalo, no giraffes, and best of all - NO SKUNKS!</div>
<br>
 
<center>HAWAII HOLDS THESE WORLD RECORDS:</center>
<br>
<div class="indent">&bull; The wettest spot on earth is found in Hawaii.<br><br>
&bull; The world's largest wind generator is on the island of Oahu. The
windmill has two blades 400 feet long on the top of a tower twenty stories
high.<br><br>
&bull; On the island of Maui is the world's largest dormant volcano.<br><br>
&bull; On the Big Island of Hawaii, you will find the world's most active
volcano - Kilauea.<br><br>
&bull; On the island of Molokai are the world's highest sea cliffs.<br><br>
&bull; The tallest mountain in the world, measuring from its base at the ocean
floor, is found on the Big Island.</div>

<div class="black">NARRATOR: While our Hawaiian couple enjoy their fruit bowl,
here are a few interesting facts about the Pineapple.<br>
<br>
<div class="indent">&bull; More than one-third of the world's commercial supply
of pineapples comes from Hawaii.<br><br>
&bull; No one is certain when pineapples were first grown in Hawaii, but
historians believe that a Spanish shipwreck in 1527 on the South Kona coast on
the Big Island of Hawaii brought tools, garments and plants, including
pineapples, from Mexico to Hawaii.<br><br>
&bull; Approximately 27,000 to 33,000 plants are planted in an acre, and the
work is all done by hand.<br><br>
&bull; The entire island of Lanai was purchased in 1922 by Jim Dole for $1.2
million - a huge sum of money in those days. For many years, this island was
the heart of Dole's pineapple operations.<br><br>
&bull; In more recent years, however, high labor and transportation costs have
made pineapple production uneconomic on this island paradise. By 1994, Dole
ceased virtually all of its pineapple production on Lanai and moved it to
Thailand and the Philippines.<br><br>
&bull; When Allan and Linda visit the Dole plantation, they will walk through
the "World's Largest Maze" according to the 2001 Guinness Book of World
Records. In the center of the maze is a huge pineapple. The maze covers an area
of more than two acres with a path length of 1.7 miles. It is made of 11,400
colorful Hawaiian plants, including varieties of hibiscus, the official state
flower. Allan and Linda are going to have a competition to see who will get
through the maze first. And now the choir is going to remind us that God leads
us out of the maze of despair when we focus our eyes on our beautiful
Saviour.</div>

<br>
<div class="black">NARRATOR: And now for more interesting trivia about Hawaii's
religious past.<br>
<br>
<div class="indent">&bull; When the missionaries arrived in Hawaii, the women
wore little or no clothing. So the missionaries designed the long, full-flowing
muu-muu, and we all agree that it is a most comfortable garment.
<br><br>
&bull; The Hawaiians had often seen white men, but the sight of white women
was new to them, so when the missionary women came to Hawaii, Samuel Kamakau
described it thus:
<br><br>
&bull; ...the people came in crowds, men, women, and children, and exclaimed
over the pretty faces of the white women, their deep-set eyes, their bonnets
that jutted forward, their long necks which won for them the name "Long Neck."
Crowds gathered, and one and another exclaimed: 'How white the women are...what
long necks...but pleasing to look at...what pinched-in bodies...what tight
clothing above and wide below.'"
<br><br>

 &bull; Before the missionaries came, music was a chant, not singing as we know it
today. Most of the beautiful Hawaiian music is because of the influence of
Christian music. The Hawaiian word for "music" comes from the root word
"hymn."</div>
<br>
<div class="indent">&bull; Living quarters for missionaries were not of Hilton
Hotel comfort. One of the missionary ladies, Lucy Thurston, described her
Hawaiian home:<br>
<br>
<div class="indent2">&hellip;our home was an abode of the most uncouth and
humble character. It was a thatched hut, with one room, having two windows made
by cutting away the thatch. On the ground for the feet was first a layer of
grass, then a covering of mats.</div>
<br>
 &bull; Here was one way to find a wife in a hurry. The American Board of
Commissioners for Foreign Missions, an interdenominational body, composed
mostly of Presbyterians and Congregationalists, organized a mission to the
Hawaiian Islands. Before the mission could sail, wives had to be obtained for
the six bachelors in the party. Within the space of two months, brides were
found and marriages performed. This missionary group consisted of the
following, plus their wives:<br>
<br>
<div class="indent2">Two ordained ministers; a physician; two teachers; a
printer; a farmer; four Hawaiians.</div>
<br>
It took them five months to reach Hawaii - as they went from Boston via the
Cape Horn route to the Pacific Ocean.<br>
<br>
 &bull; We may wonder why a printer was chosen to go to Hawaii. Printing began
in 1822 in Hawaii, and soon the Hawaiians could see their own words in print.
In 1826, Christian missionaries converted the Hawaiian language into a written
alphabet which consisted of only TWELVE letters: 7 consonants and 5 vowels. By
May 1839, the entire Bible had been translated and printed in the Hawaiian
language.<br>
<br>
 &bull; The earliest school buildings were nothing more than grass huts with a
few mats laid over a dirt floor. The strategy of the missionaries was to bring
the king and chiefs to conversion, for then the people would follow their
leaders. This would not be an easy task. For example, the king would have had
to give up four of his five wives and abstain from drinking rum. "No way," said
the king!"<br>
<br>
 &bull; In the Bible we read about the Cities of Refuge. Amazingly, before the
Hawaiians had any knowledge of the Bible, they also had cities of refuge on the
Big Island. These were established as havens for lawbreakers and for those
vanquished in war.<br>
<br>
 &bull; It is sad to note that before the white man came to Hawaii, drunkenness
was unknown because there were no alcoholic beverages. It was one culture which
had not discovered the laws of fermentation.</div>

<center>Allen and Linda re-enter stage and sit down</center>
<br>
 ALLAN: Wasn't that just the best-tasting pineapple in the world? And to think
you got through the maze two minutes ahead of me! You're one smart gal. Now,
let's hear about your research on the Christian faith in Hawaii.<br>
<br>
 LINDA: (holds up booklet) Here's what I found out. The first group of American
missionaries arrived in Honolulu in 1820 from New England. The missionaries
brought a mission house with them, a pre-fabricated building that still stands
today. It is the oldest wooden structure on the islands.<br>
<br>
 ALLAN: And because Christianity became a dominant faith in the islands,
Christianity was declared to be the national religion of Hawaii. And if you
think that coffee seems to be the national drink of Hawaii, blame the
missionaries. They introduced the coffee tree to the islands.<br>
<br>
 LINDA: I hope we can visit some of the interesting churches, Allan. I
understand that the Kawaihao Church in Honolulu is constructed of giant coral
slabs, and the cemetery out back is where many of the Islands' earliest
missionaries are buried. If we get to the Big Island, one of the churches there
is built of lava rock. The walls of the church are painted with a series of
biblical scenes because in earlier years, native Hawaiians couldn't read.
Hawaii's first Christian church is in Kona. Another interesting church is on
the island of Hawaii. And on the island of Kauai is an old Lutheran Church.
German immigrants to the area designed the interior to look like the ship that
brought them there. The floor slants like the deck of a ship, the balcony looks
like a captain's bridge, and there are ship lanterns hanging from the
ceiling.<br>

with the ukelele and the steel guitar are fascinating.<br>
<br>
 
<center><img alt="" src="haw_uke.gif"></center>
<br>
<br>
NARRATOR: One would think that any research on the Hawaiian guitar would be
done by someone of Hawaiian ancestry. Not so. A Vancouver lady named Lorene
Ruymar was a music teacher in the public school system. She is a skilled steel
guitar player and, along with her husband, plays professionally for many
events. In 1996 Lorene published a 200-page comprehensive book on "The Hawaiian
Steel Guitar and its Great Hawaiian Musicians." We are proud of our local
talent! As you know, the Hawaiian steel guitar is so called because the notes
are made by using a steel which is held in the left hand, and the right hand
plucks the strings with picks on the finger.<br>
<br>
 Neither the steel guitar nor the ukelele originated with the Hawaiian people.
The ukelele was a Portuguese instrument which was brought to the Islands. In
the 1870's, a British officer named Purvis retired in Hawaii. Because of his
miniature size and lively ways, the natives called him "Little Flea." He became
an expert on this Portuguese stringed instrument. When he played it, it
reminded the natives of a flea hopping, so they gave the instrument the same
name: UKELELE which means "Little Flea."<br>
<br>
 The origin of the steel guitar is attributed to Joseph Kekuku. He had his
guitar on his lap, and when he opened a parcel, a pocket knife fell out of the
package and struck the strings. He noted that the tone produced by the steel
knife produced a tone much better than any of the other objects with which he
had experimented. In 1988, a proclamation was issued in Hawaii to celebrate the
100th anniversary of the steel guitar.<br>

BILLY HEW LEN:<br>
Viola Pahl, the author of this musical, plays a Hawaiian steel guitar. In the
1970s she came across a gentleman named Billy Hew Len playing a steel guitar in
a shopping mall. Little did Viola know what a special person Billy was. He was
one of 12 children. When he was ten years old, he started to play his cousin's
guitar. At age 17, tragedy struck. He was using a planing machine, and due to
an accident, his left hand was cut off at the wrist. The stark realization that
he would never play the steel guitar again devastated Billy. An elder in the
Mormon Church, who worked with handicapped people, invented a sort of glove
that would fit over the wrist. A machine shop made a special steel bar which
was attached to the glove. After much patience and perseverance, Billy Hew Len
again played the steel guitar and became one of Hawaii's outstanding steel
guitar players. Viola's great regret is that she did not know the facts
surrounding Billy Hew Len until after she had met him.<br>
<br>
 BENNIE NAWAHI<br>
In TIME magazine July 31, 2000, there was a fascinating story about Bennie
Nawahi. He was born in 1899. As a teenager, he played for pennies in the parks
of Honolulu, often teaming up with Sol Hoopii - I'll talk about Sol just a
little later. When Bennie was 36 years old, he suddenly went blind and never
regained his sight. Nonetheless, he kept on playing for the next 40 years in
nightclubs and restaurants. How Bennie did it is a marvelous feat.<br>
<br>
 SOL HOOPII<br>
Finally, there is Sol Hoopii - born in 1902, the first of 21 children and a
musical genius at the age of three. He became famous in Hollywood in his early
twenties. Those of us who are of a very mature age will remember the name of
movie actress Mary Pickford. When she had to play a scene requiring her to cry,
she would insist on Sol's steel guitar playing to give her the proper emotion.
(Viola Pahl makes this comment: "I can bring tears to people's eyes, too, when
I play my steel guitar, but theirs are tears of anguish because of the horrible
way I play.") At age 36, Sol came in contact with the Christian community, and
for the remainder of his short life - he died at age 51 - he dedicated his
talent to the Lord's work. The next song was one of Sol's favourites.<br>
